# Investment Research - All Points

**Company Ticker:** NVDA  
**Date:** October 06, 2025  

### Evaluation Summary

Point 0 Decision: Pass
Rationale: The company has operated commercially since the mid-1990s and reported positive GAAP operating income in FY2023, FY2024, and FY2025. Operating income was $4.2B, $33.0B, and $81.5B respectively.

Point 1 Decision: Fail
Rationale: Evidence includes a 2022 SEC penalty for inadequate disclosures and revived shareholder litigation, plus disclosed employment and high compensation of the CEO’s children. These factors contradict a clean record of trusteeship despite performance-based pay and governance policies.

Point 2 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Data-center/AI products drove outsized growth with dominant market share, robust roadmaps (Blackwell/Rubin), and a large developer ecosystem. While export-control and concentration risks exist, the evidence supports multi‑year sales potential.

Point 3 Decision: Pass
Rationale: SG&A was 2.7% of revenue vs double‑digit peers and revenue per employee was far higher, indicating sales/distribution efficiency. The company also runs extensive partner and training programs, despite some allegations and probes of aggressive sales practices.

Point 4 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Management’s strategy emphasizes continuous platform development, heavy R&D, expansion into software/services, and ecosystem blueprints to sustain growth across markets.

Point 5 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Board independence, an active Lead Director, director re‑elections, and a strong say‑on‑pay vote indicate confidence. The Compensation Committee conducts formal, regular reviews and sets executive pay and goals.

Point 6 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Filings report no strikes/work stoppages, a largely non‑unionized workforce, low turnover (~2.5%), and strong benefits and grievance processes. Pay parity analyses and above‑market median compensation further support positive labor relations.

Point 7 Decision: Pass
Rationale: The company pays premiums and makes advance commitments to secure supply and invests in customer support/services. It has also forwent near‑term profit (e.g., LHR, CMP, free CUDA/tools) to build long‑term relationships and ecosystem value.

Point 8 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Management disclosed negative developments (e.g., 2022 preliminary shortfall, $4.5B H20 charge) via 8‑Ks, calls, and MD&A with quantification and context. Calls show direct Q&A on tough topics and consistent tone across periods.

Point 9 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Distinctive advantages cited include the CUDA ecosystem, full‑stack systems (compute, networking, software), large patent portfolio, dominant share, and advanced packaging/capacity access.

Point 10 Decision: Pass
Rationale: With ~$43–57B in cash and securities, strong operating cash flow ($64B FY2025), modest debt (~$8.5B), and ongoing buybacks, growth and commitments appear fundable without equity issuance. A shelf exists but no specific common stock offering was announced.

Point 11 Decision: Pass
Rationale: GAAP operating margins for the last five fiscal years were ~62.4%, 54.1%, 15.7%, 37.3%, and 27.2%, averaging ~39.35%. These levels are clearly worthwhile.

Point 12 Decision: Fail
Rationale: While an experienced bench exists, the company has not disclosed a formal succession plan and the CEO explicitly indicated no successor, highlighting key‑person risk. Governance materials emphasize CEO centrality.

Point 13 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Gross/operating margins expanded sharply, with management tying improvements to higher‑margin data‑center mix and setting explicit mid‑70% gross‑margin targets. Cost/efficiency initiatives (Blackwell, networking, Omniverse) and regular guidance support ongoing margin management.

Point 14 Decision: Pass
Rationale: High operating profits, strong liquidity, disciplined capex scaling, and large, deliberate buybacks indicate sound capital allocation. Despite inventory/purchase‑obligation charges from export controls, auditors issued clean opinions on controls in 2024 and 2025.

Point 15 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Large R&D outlays translated into massive Data Center revenue ($115.2B FY2025), high margins, and major product launches (Hopper/Blackwell) supported by a multi‑million developer ecosystem. The company maintains multi‑year programs and repeatedly commercializes them.

Point 16 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Dominant share, MLPerf‑demonstrated performance/efficiency gains, and system‑level integration suggest at least parity with the lowest‑cost producers. Scale advantages (reserved advanced packaging, full‑stack offerings) reinforce future cost position.

Point 17 Decision: Pass
Rationale: Management frequently acknowledges rapid change and has executed restructurings and pivots (segment realignment, Mellanox integration, Icera wind‑down, product redesigns for export rules) to adapt.

Point 18 Decision: Fail
Rationale: Although scale and ecosystem advantages are strong, multiple ongoing antitrust inquiries (DOJ, EU, France) and a Chinese regulator’s preliminary violation finding indicate meaningful regulatory risk. The evidence does not show a clear ability to avoid actions that could threaten its position.

Investment Research for NVDA - All Questions
============================================================

### Point 0 Criterion

Does the company have at least two or three years of commercial operation and one year of operating profit?

## Point 0 - Question 1

**Does the company have at least two or three years of commercial operation and one year of operating profit?**

### Research Findings

- Company founding: NVIDIA was founded on April 5, 1993. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline//?utm_source=openai))

- First commercial product and early sales: NVIDIA’s first graphics product, the NV1 multimedia PCI card, was introduced in May 1995 and sold later that year. The RIVA 128 graphics chip followed in 1997 and brought wider market recognition. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NV1?utm_source=openai))

- Fiscal-year timing (how NVIDIA reports years): NVIDIA’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in January (they use a 52- or 53-week fiscal year). This means a “fiscal year 2024” covers the 12 months ending the last Sunday in January 2024, etc. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000264/nvda-20240728.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Operating income (profit from running the business, before interest and taxes) — fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025: operating income was $81,453 million (about $81.5 billion). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Operating income — fiscal year ended Jan 28, 2024: operating income was $32,972 million (about $33.0 billion). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- Operating income — fiscal year ended Jan 29, 2023: operating income was $4,224 million (about $4.2 billion). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

---

### Point 1 Criterion

Is there not evidence of a lack of strong management sense of trusteeship for stockholders?

## Point 1 - Question 1

**Are executive salaries significantly above industry norms without clear justification?**

### Research Findings

- Company and period: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker NVDA). The company’s fiscal year 2025 ended January 26, 2025; the proxy statement covering executive pay for that year was filed May 13, 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA total revenue for fiscal 2025 (the year ended January 26, 2025) was $130.5 billion. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

- Jensen (Jen‑Hsun) Huang, NVIDIA’s president and CEO, total reported compensation for fiscal 2025 was $49,866,251. This total breaks down in the company’s proxy as: base salary $1,486,199; stock awards $38,811,306; non‑equity incentive plan (cash bonus) $6,000,000; and “all other” compensation $3,568,746. (These amounts are for the fiscal year that ended January 26, 2025 and are shown in the company’s Summary Compensation Table.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- For comparison, Jensen Huang’s fiscal 2024 compensation (the prior year) was reported as $34,167,902, with base salary $996,514; stock awards $26,676,415; non‑equity incentive $4,000,000; and other $2,494,973. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA’s proxy says most executive pay is “at‑risk” (depends on company performance) and that for fiscal 2025 the performance metrics used included annual revenue, annual non‑GAAP operating income, and three‑year relative total shareholder return (TSR) versus the S&P 500. The proxy also says the CEO’s equity awards are 100% performance‑based (no time‑vested fixed RSUs for the CEO). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA’s compensation committee explanation: for fiscal 2025 the committee raised the CEO’s base salary (to $1.5 million) and target equity to align with peer company medians and for “internal pay equity,” and the committee stated this raised the CEO’s base for the first time in 10 years. The proxy records that the committee increased the CEO’s total target pay by $7 million to move closer to the peer median and split the CEO’s target equity evenly between short‑term and multi‑year performance stock units. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA reported the median total compensation for its employees for fiscal 2025 as $301,233, and the company reported a CEO‑to‑median‑employee pay ratio of 166:1 for fiscal 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA disclosed the CEO’s share ownership and unvested equity: the proxy shows Jensen Huang (and related trusts) beneficially owned a large number of shares (about 3.77% of outstanding shares as reported in the proxy) and the proxy lists the estimated value of unvested awards and unvested/uneared performance share units attributable to him (hundreds of millions of dollars of unvested/uneared equity value at the measurement dates in the proxy). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- Example peer CEO compensation amounts (reported in those companies’ filings or major news reports) for recent fiscal years, to provide direct comparisons:
  - AMD — Lisa T. Su: total reported compensation for fiscal 2024 about $31.0 million (includes base salary, stock awards, options, and incentives). ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-067170/d869673ddef14a.htm?utm_source=openai))  
  - Qualcomm — Cristiano R. Amon: total reported compensation for fiscal 2024 about $25.9 million (base salary ~$1.35M; stock awards ~$20.0M; non‑equity incentive ~$3.75M). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/804328/000110465925005602/tm2430012d3_def14a.htm?utm_source=openai))  
  - Broadcom — Hock E. Tan: news and filings reported very large equity awards in 2023 that produced reported total compensation figures in the high nine‑figure to low eight‑figure range when measured at grant values (for example, media and filing coverage cited a $160.5M performance stock award that pushed reported 2023 compensation to about $161.8M). (Broadcom’s proxy explains that award was “front‑loaded” and vests over multiple years with performance conditions.) ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/broadcom-ceo-compensation-more-than-doubles-1618-mln-2023-2024-02-27/?utm_source=openai))

- Examples of the form of pay that commonly makes up large reported CEO totals:
  - Stock awards and performance share units are often the largest line item in the Summary Compensation Table; their reported dollar values are the grant‑date accounting fair value, not a guaranteed cash payment, and vesting depends on time and/or performance targets. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA’s proxy also shows specific payouts under its cash incentive plan for fiscal 2025 (for many named executives the company reports a 200% payout under its Variable Cash Plan because fiscal 2025 revenue exceeded the proxy’s “Stretch Compensation Plan” goal). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

## Point 1 - Question 2

**Are relatives of executives employed by the company, and if so, are they overcompensated relative to their roles?**

### Research Findings

- Ticker NVDA is NVIDIA Corporation. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- The company’s 2025 proxy statement says the daughter and the son of Jensen (Jen‑Hsun) Huang are employed by NVIDIA. It says they do not live with Mr. Huang, they are not company executive officers, and they do not report directly to him. (Fiscal 2025 in these filings refers to the year ended January 26, 2025.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- Jensen Huang’s daughter, Madison Huang, works at NVIDIA as a director-level marketing lead for Omniverse and robotics-related products. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/author/madisonh/?utm_source=openai))

- Jensen Huang’s son, Spencer Huang, works at NVIDIA as a product manager focused on cloud and robotics simulation technologies (Isaac/robotics cloud). ([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/author/spencerh/?utm_source=openai))

- The proxy statement reports the total compensation for Fiscal 2025 for Jensen Huang’s daughter was approximately $1,130,000 and for his son was approximately $530,000. The proxy also says each has received, and continues to be eligible for, equity awards on the same general terms as other employees. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- The company’s 2025 proxy also says the son of “Dr. Shah,” a NVIDIA director, has been employed by NVIDIA since February 2024. He does not live with Dr. Shah, is not an executive officer, and his total compensation for Fiscal 2025 was approximately $475,000. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- The director referred to as “Dr. Shah” on NVIDIA’s board is Aarti Shah (Dr. Aarti Shah). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA’s 2023 proxy statement shows that Jensen Huang’s daughter’s total compensation for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 did not exceed $165,000 (an earlier reported figure before the Fiscal 2025 amount above). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000080/nvda-20230508.htm?utm_source=openai))

---

## Point 1 - Question 3

**Does management or their family own properties leased or sold to the company? Are these transactions conducted at or above market rates? Are such arrangements disclosed transparently in filings?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s 2025 proxy statement (filed May 1, 2025) says: except as described in that section, there were no transactions with related persons in fiscal 2025 that would require disclosure or approval by the company’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- The same 2025 proxy discloses that the daughter and son of Jen‑Hsun (Jensen) Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, are employed by the company; their total compensation in fiscal 2025 was reported as approximately $1,130,000 and $530,000, respectively. The proxy also discloses that the son of director Aarti Shah has been employed since February 2024 and earned about $475,000 in fiscal 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- The proxy states that NVIDIA’s policy requires review of all related‑party transactions for conflicts of interest, and that transactions involving executive officers or directors must be approved by the NCGC in line with company policy and Nasdaq listing rules. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- NVIDIA’s Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 incorporates the proxy statement’s related‑party section by reference (so the proxy disclosures are part of the company’s annual SEC disclosure). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- A November 6, 2017 Form 8‑K reports that NVIDIA Land Development, LLC (an NVIDIA subsidiary) exercised an option to buy the company’s Santa Clara property from Wachovia for approximately $350 million; that filing describes what the purchase price approximated (repayment, capitalized interest, unpaid rent, fees/expenses). The filing does not state that the price was compared to or certified as “market” rate. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581017000164/form8-kq3fy18.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA publicly reported purchasing its Santa Clara headquarters campus in 2024 for about $374.3 million (news reports of the transaction and public records). Those reports give the cash purchase amount and square footage but do not state a company certification that the price was at or above market. ([sfgate.com](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/nvidia-buys-silicon-valley-office-complex-20313739.php?utm_source=openai))

- In early 2025 NVIDIA agreed to buy a 500,000‑square‑foot Santa Clara campus from The Sobrato Organization; initial reports said the purchase price was not disclosed in county filings. Later reporting and public records show NVIDIA paid roughly $254 million for three of the buildings (about $84.7 million each) and paid about $83.2 million for another building at the same complex in separate transactions reported in 2025. Those news reports give purchase amounts per building but do not present a company statement that the prices were validated as “market” rates. ([therealdeal.com](https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2025/01/31/nvidia-buys-500k-sf-santa-clara-office-campus-from-sobrato/?utm_source=openai))

- In May 2025 NVIDIA bought the nearby Santa Clara Commerce Park (10 buildings) for $123 million from a Blackstone affiliate, according to news reports; the reports list the cash price and describe the property and tenants. The coverage does not quote a company statement that the price equaled or exceeded an independent market appraisal. ([commercialsearch.com](https://www.commercialsearch.com/news/blackstone-sells-silicon-valley-asset-to-nvidia-for-123m/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s financial filings and SEC reports (Form 10‑K, Form 8‑K and proxy filings) disclose property ownership, lease obligations, and the terms or amounts of major property purchases or lease financing arrangements (for example, the 2016–2018 build‑to‑suit lease/ground‑lease arrangements and the 2017 purchase described above). Those filings provide purchase prices, lease terms, and accounting treatment; they do not, in the cited examples, include an explicit statement that a transaction price was determined to be at-or-above market rate. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581016000353/nvda2017q310q.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Company press coverage and public property records used in reporting (county filings, commercial real‑estate press) were sources for the purchase prices and dates listed above; some early filings or reports sometimes did not disclose purchase prices at the time of announcement (and later public records or reporting provided more detail). ([therealdeal.com](https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2025/01/31/nvidia-buys-500k-sf-santa-clara-office-campus-from-sobrato/?utm_source=openai))

---

## Point 1 - Question 4

**Do vendors or service providers have ownership or financial ties to insiders or their relatives?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s 2025 proxy statement (filed May 2025) says that, other than items the company lists, “there were no transactions with related persons in Fiscal 2025 that would require disclosure in this proxy statement or approval by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC).” ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- The same proxy explains the company’s rule: employees, officers and directors must avoid activities that conflict with NVIDIA’s interests, and “all transactions involving executive officers or directors must be approved by the NCGC” in line with Nasdaq listing rules. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- The proxy discloses that two children of Jensen (Jen‑Hsun) Huang (NVIDIA’s CEO) and a son of director Aarti Shah are employed by NVIDIA. They do not share a household with those insiders, are not executive officers, and their Fiscal 2025 total compensation amounts (base pay plus other pay and equity) are listed as approximately $1,130,000 and $530,000 for Mr. Huang’s two children and approximately $475,000 for Dr. Shah’s son. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- NVIDIA’s annual reports and SEC filings state the company uses third parties to manufacture, assemble and provide other services for its products — i.e., NVIDIA relies on outside vendors and service providers for manufacturing and cloud/infra services. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA publicly names major external partners and suppliers (examples in company press releases and filings include Foxconn/Hon Hai and TSMC as manufacturing or infrastructure partners). Those partners are described as separate companies working with NVIDIA. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/Foxconn-Builds-AI-Factory-in-Partnership-With-Taiwan-and-NVIDIA/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has taken an equity position in at least one service provider: public filings and news reporting show NVIDIA owned roughly $900 million of CoreWeave shares at the end of Q1 2025 (about a ~5% stake reported around CoreWeave’s IPO) and increased holdings reported in later filings and press coverage. This is a financial tie between NVIDIA (the company) and a cloud service provider. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/nvidia-owned-900-million-worth-of-coreweave-shares-q1-filing-shows.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s 2025 proxy and its 2025 Form 10‑K do not list any vendor or service provider as being owned by NVIDIA insiders or by their relatives; the proxy explicitly states there were no related‑person transactions requiring disclosure in Fiscal 2025 other than the employee relationships noted above. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

---

## Point 1 - Question 5

**Has management issued themselves stock options in excessive quantities?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA has not had any stock options outstanding since the end of its fiscal year 2024. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- NVIDIA’s equity awards are mostly restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). RSUs are promises to deliver company shares later if the person stays employed; PSUs are similar but the final number of shares depends on meeting performance goals. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm))

- As of January 26, 2025, 274,212,251 shares were issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs and PSUs. The same date showed 3,628,661,705 shares remained available for future issuance under NVIDIA’s equity plans (this total includes the company’s employee stock purchase plan).

- NVIDIA reported $15.3 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation related to RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs as of April 27, 2025; the company said this amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years for those awards. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm))

- The company discloses that during fiscal 2025 it withheld about 59 million shares (worth about $6.9 billion) to cover tax withholding when RSUs vested (these shares were not newly issued to the executives— they were withheld from shares otherwise payable on vesting). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

## Point 1 - Question 6

**Do equity grants appear misaligned with company performance or shareholder interests?**

### Research Findings

- Company: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker: NVDA). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- CEO: Jen‑Hsun (Jensen) Huang is President and Chief Executive Officer. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- CEO cash and stock pay for fiscal 2025 (company’s proxy): base salary ~$1,486,199; stock awards reported at $38,811,306; non‑equity incentive $6,000,000; total reported compensation $49,866,251 for fiscal 2025. (These numbers are the company’s Summary Compensation Table values for fiscal 2025.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- “Compensation actually paid” (CAP) for the CEO, a separate SEC‑required measure that adjusts for changes in award values, is reported as $344,188,027 for fiscal 2025 (much larger than the Summary Compensation Table total). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Types of equity awards used by NVIDIA executives:
  - RSUs: restricted stock units that vest for service over time. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - SY PSUs: single‑year performance stock units that vest based on one year company performance (company used Fiscal 2025 Non‑GAAP Operating Income as the SY metric). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - MY PSUs: multi‑year PSUs measured by 3‑year relative total shareholder return (TSR) vs. the S&P 500, with vesting after three years and a 60‑trading‑day average price used to measure TSR. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- CEO‑specific PSU details shown in the proxy:
  - Fiscal‑2025 SY PSUs for Jensen Huang: target shown as 190,900 shares; actual eligible to vest at the achieved level shown as 286,350 shares (value shown in the proxy at the January 24, 2025 closing price). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - MY PSUs granted in fiscal 2023 that became eligible to vest: 670,130 shares for the CEO (reported value shown in the proxy). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Payout caps and vesting notes in the proxy:
  - The Compensation Committee capped the CEO’s SY and MY PSU payouts at 150% of target (other NEOs had a 200% cap) because all of the CEO’s fiscal‑2025 equity was performance‑based, while other NEOs received some time‑based RSUs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - For SY PSUs: 25% vested about one year after grant, and then 6.25% vests approximately every three months thereafter until fully vested (four‑year schedule for those SY PSUs). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Stock‑based compensation expense (company financials):
  - NVIDIA reported stock‑based compensation expense of $4,737 million for fiscal 2025 and $3,549 million for fiscal 2024 (these amounts are included in the company’s reconciliation of GAAP to Non‑GAAP operating income).

  - As of April 27, 2025 the company reported 274 million RSUs/PSUs outstanding, granted 44 million in the most recent quarter, vested 39 million in that quarter, and reported aggregate unearned (not yet recognized) stock‑based compensation of $15.3 billion to be recognized over a weighted average of ~2.3 years for RSUs/PSUs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Shares issued / withheld / repurchased (equity dilution and buyback activity reported by the company):
  - During fiscal 2025 the company withheld approximately 59 million shares to pay taxes on RSU vesting (net share settlement), with a stated total value of about $6.9 billion. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))
  - In the company’s fiscal‑2025 fourth quarter (Oct 28, 2024 – Jan 26, 2025) NVIDIA repurchased 55.3 million shares; from Jan 27, 2025 through Feb 21, 2025 the company repurchased 29 million additional shares for $3.7 billion under a trading plan.

  - The proxy shows that during fiscal 2025 the company granted an aggregate of 82,467,905 shares (counting PSUs at their maximum potential) under the 2007 Plan and that 30,121,348 shares were purchased under the ESPP during fiscal 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - The proxy’s plan summary reports 274,212,251 shares associated with outstanding RSUs/PSUs and 3,628,661,705 shares remaining available for future issuance under equity plans (this “available” number includes large counts for the 2007 Plan and ESPP after the company’s June 2024 ten‑for‑one stock split). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Vesting and realized value to named executives in fiscal 2025:
  - The proxy shows shares acquired on vesting in fiscal 2025 for named executives: Jensen Huang acquired 1,900,210 shares on vesting with a gross realized value of $186,549,758 (shares were withheld for taxes from the gross amount). Similar vesting‑and‑value entries are listed for other NEOs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Stock options: the company states it had no stock options outstanding since the end of fiscal 2024; its equity awards are RSUs and PSUs rather than options. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Board share‑repurchase authorization update: on August 26, 2025 the Board approved an additional $60.0 billion to the company’s share repurchase authorization (company press release). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Insider sales and trading plans (public filings and press coverage):
  - The company disclosed that CEO Jensen Huang adopted a Rule 10b5‑1 plan on March 20, 2025 to sell up to 6 million shares in 2025; the company also disclosed similar prearranged plans by other executives. (Such plans set dates/amounts in advance for insider sales.) ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/jensen-huang-nvidia-stock-sale-plan-4afe3989?utm_source=openai))

- How the company measures relative TSR for MY PSUs: 3‑year TSR is measured using cumulative stock price appreciation with dividends reinvested and averaged using the 60 trading days before the start and before the end of the performance period to smooth short‑term price moves. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Amounts reported for fiscal‑2025 grants and actual eligible vesting under performance tests (examples from proxy):
  - For several NEOs (including the CEO), the company reports that fiscal‑2025 Non‑GAAP Operating Income exceeded the “Stretch Compensation Plan goal,” which produced 150% or 200% of target opportunity becoming eligible to vest for certain PSU grants (the proxy lists the resulting numbers of shares eligible to vest for each named executive).

## Point 1 - Question 7

**Are option grants structured to benefit insiders disproportionately?**

### Research Findings

- Company name: NVDA is the ticker for NVIDIA Corporation. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Types of equity awards currently used: NVIDIA mainly gives restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs), and market-based PSUs. NVIDIA says it has not had any stock options outstanding since the end of fiscal 2024. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- What an RSU is and how it vests: an RSU is a promise to give company shares later if the person stays employed. NVIDIA’s RSUs generally vest over about four years (for example, 25% at a set date near the first anniversary and the rest in quarterly installments). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- What a PSU is and how it vests: a PSU is a promise to give shares only if the company hits specific performance goals. NVIDIA’s PSUs usually vest over several years and the exact number of shares that vest depends on meeting performance targets. Market-based PSUs vest based on stock-market conditions and often vest on a three-year anniversary if the market condition is met. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Performance measures named in NVIDIA filings: NVIDIA uses measures such as non‑GAAP operating income for some single‑year PSUs and three‑year relative total shareholder return (TSR) versus the S&P 500 for multi‑year PSUs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- How many equity shares were granted in fiscal 2025 and who received them: In fiscal 2025 NVIDIA granted 82,467,905 shares under its 2007 Plan in the form of RSUs and PSUs. Of those, 1,655,590 shares were granted to the named executive officers (NEOs), 26,137 to non‑employee directors, and 80,786,178 to other employees. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Shares available for future grants (as of January 26, 2025): NVIDIA reported 1,388,693,763 shares available under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and 2,239,967,942 shares reserved under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Insider ownership levels (snapshot dates shown in the filing): as of March 24, 2025 NVIDIA reported Jen‑Hsun (Jensen) Huang beneficially owned 922,922,938 shares (reported as 3.77% of outstanding shares). All directors and executive officers as a group were shown as owning 1,020,441,222 shares (about 4.17%). (Footnotes in the filing explain many of Huang’s shares are held through trusts and related entities.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Change‑in‑control and acceleration language: NVIDIA’s 2007 Plan lets the surviving company assume awards in a sale. If awards are not assumed, awards held by people who are still providing services immediately before the transaction may accelerate (vest) in full; other awards may be terminated if not exercised before the transaction. NVIDIA also shows estimated dollar benefits for unvested RSUs/PSUs that would vest on a change in control. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Recent cash/stock realized by NEOs when awards vested: NVIDIA’s “Option Exercises and Stock Vested” table shows, for example, that in fiscal 2025 the CEO acquired 1,900,210 shares on vesting with a reported value realized of $186,549,758 (gross, before tax withholding). The filing reiterates the company had no stock options outstanding since the end of fiscal 2024. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

### Research Findings

- Company name and ticker: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Board size and independence: At the 2025 proxy the Board nominated 13 directors and the Board said that all directors except CEO Jen‑Hsun (Jensen) Huang are independent under Nasdaq rules. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Board leadership: The Board uses an independent Lead Director (Stephen C. Neal) instead of a combined chair/CEO, and the Lead Director has duties to meet with independent directors, set agendas, and engage with large stockholders. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Board committees: The Board has three standing committees (Audit, Compensation, Nominating & Corporate Governance).

- Stockholder voting and charter provisions: NVIDIA’s certificate of incorporation requires some charter changes to be approved by a 66 2/3% supermajority vote unless changed. The company proposed an amended charter to remove supermajority provisions at the 2025 meeting. That charter amendment was put to a vote and stockholders did not approve the change (vote tallies reported by the company). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Stockholder special meeting right: NVIDIA amended its bylaws in 2024 to allow stockholders who own at least 15% of shares for at least one year to request a special meeting. A 2025 stockholder proposal to remove the one‑year holding requirement was voted on and was not approved. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Stockholder votes on pay (say‑on‑pay): At the 2025 annual meeting, shareholders gave advisory approval to the company’s executive compensation disclosure (the advisory “say‑on‑pay” vote passed; the company published the vote counts). ([streetinsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC%2BFilings/Form%2B8-K%2BNVIDIA%2BCORP%2BFor%3A%2BJun%2B25/25000593.html?utm_source=openai))

- Executive pay design (how pay is awarded): For fiscal 2025 the company states its executive pay is “pay for performance.” The proxy says about 95% of the CEO’s total target pay was dependent on company performance, and a large part of executive pay is equity that vests only if performance goals are met. The proxy includes the detailed Summary Compensation Table for fiscal years 2023–2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- CEO total compensation (reported): The proxy shows the CEO’s reported total compensation for fiscal 2025 in the proxy’s pay table (the proxy includes the Summary Compensation Table totals and “compensation actually paid” reconciliations for the CEO). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- CEO and insider ownership (reported beneficial ownership): As of March 24, 2025 the proxy reports Jen‑Hsun Huang’s total beneficial ownership as 922,922,938 shares (about 3.77% of outstanding shares, as reported in the proxy’s ownership table). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- CEO stock sales and trading plans: Public filings and news reports show CEO Jensen Huang adopted a Rule 10b5‑1 trading plan in March 2025 and executed planned sales under that program during mid‑2025; the sales were disclosed in SEC filings and reported in the press. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/nvidia-stock-ceo-jensen-huang-sale.html?utm_source=openai))

- Dividends: NVIDIA pays a small quarterly cash dividend. Starting late 2024 the company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share on a post‑split basis; the company has continued to declare $0.01 quarterly dividends in 2025. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2025/?utm_source=openai))

- Share repurchases (board authorizations and amounts returned): 
  - On August 26, 2024 the Board approved an additional $50.0 billion share repurchase authorization (no expiration), announced with fiscal results. The company reported it returned $15.4 billion to shareholders (buybacks + dividends) in the first half of fiscal 2025. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2025/?utm_source=openai)) 
  - On August 26, 2025 the Board approved an additional $60.0 billion repurchase authorization (no expiration), and the company reported returning $24.3 billion to shareholders in the first half of fiscal 2026. The company also reported the amount remaining under the prior repurchase authorization at quarter end before the new authorization. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2026?utm_source=openai))

- Amounts remaining under repurchase programs (as reported): As reported in NVIDIA’s quarter announcements, the company stated it had $7.5 billion remaining under its repurchase authorization at the end of Q2 fiscal 2025, and $14.7 billion remaining under prior authorization at the end of Q2 fiscal 2026 (each company press release shows the “remaining under authorization” amounts). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2025/?utm_source=openai))

- Stock split and share counts: NVIDIA completed a ten‑for‑one forward stock split effective June 7, 2024; per‑share figures reported after that date are on a post‑split basis.

  - The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan provides that outstanding stock awards may be assumed or substituted in a change‑in‑control; if not assumed, vesting may accelerate for certain awards. The proxy includes estimated benefits if unvested awards were to vest on a change‑in‑control. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- Employment and severance arrangements: The company states executive officers are “at‑will” employees and that NVIDIA does not have employment, severance, or change‑in‑control agreements with its executive officers; change‑in‑control treatment generally follows the 2007 Plan’s provisions for equity awards.

## Point 1 - Question 10

**Do insider trading activities (Forms 3, 4, 5) suggest opportunistic behavior?**

### Research Findings

- Company name and business: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker NVDA) makes graphics chips and other computer hardware and software used for gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Who counts as an “insider” for these filings: company officers, directors, and anyone who owns more than 10% of a company’s stock must file special forms with the SEC when they own or change ownership of the company’s shares. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/compliance-disclosure-interpretations/exchange-act-section-16-related-rules-forms?utm_source=openai))

- What Form 3 is: an initial report that an insider files to show what company shares they already own when they first become an insider. It must be filed soon after the person becomes an insider. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517681/000164117225001355/ex99-1.htm?utm_source=openai))

- What Form 4 is: a report insiders must file within two business days after any change in their ownership (for example, a buy, a sale, an option exercise, or restricted stock vesting). Form 4 shows the date, type, and amount of each transaction and the insider’s ownership after the trade. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517681/000164117225001355/ex99-1.htm?utm_source=openai))

- What Form 5 is: an annual report used to disclose certain transactions that were not reported earlier on Form 4 (for example, some gifts or other transactions eligible for deferred reporting). Form 5 is due within 45 days after the company’s fiscal year end, and it is filed only if there are unreported items to disclose. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517681/000164117225001355/ex99-1.htm?utm_source=openai))

- SEC rule and “10b5‑1” trading plans: Rule 10b5‑1 allows insiders to set up a written trading plan in advance that specifies how and when shares will be bought or sold. If the plan meets the rule’s conditions, trades under the plan can provide a defense against claims that the insider traded while in possession of material nonpublic information. The SEC updated Rule 10b5‑1 in 2023 to add cooling-off periods and other conditions to reduce possible abuse. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/modernizing-rule-10b5-1-insider-trading-plans?utm_source=openai))

- Company policy and pre-clearance: NVIDIA’s published insider trading policy says officers and directors must get preclearance before trading the company’s stock, and the company describes compliance steps for insider trades in its public filings (proxy statements and other SEC filings). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA proxy / Section 16 compliance (example): In its 2025 proxy statement, NVIDIA reports it reviewed copies of insiders’ Section 16 filings and said that, to its knowledge, insiders complied with filing rules for fiscal 2024, except for one late Form 4 by a named officer (an explicit disclosure the company made in its proxy). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Jensen Huang (NVIDIA founder and CEO) — ownership: NVIDIA’s public filings and proxy statements show Jensen (Jen‑hsun) Huang as a long‑time founder/CEO and a very large beneficial owner through direct holdings plus multiple trusts and entities. Proxy and Form 4 filings list his direct and indirect holdings in company documents. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000080/nvda-20230508.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Jensen Huang — recent reported transactions (examples from public filings and press coverage):
  - Huang adopted a Rule 10b5‑1 trading plan in March 2025, according to disclosures cited in media and Form 4 filings. ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sells-stock-757a91d2?utm_source=openai))
  - Under that plan, media and SEC Form 4 summaries report multiple small sales in June–August 2025, for example:
    - June 20–23, 2025: about 100,000 shares sold (average price reported ~ $144 per share). ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sells-stock-757a91d2?utm_source=openai))
    - June 24–26, 2025: about 200,000 shares sold (average price reported ~ $152 per share). ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-ai-ceo-sells-10e34795?utm_source=openai))
    - Multiple later July–August 2025 entries showing additional grouped sales (many filings indicate 75,000‑share blocks on multiple dates). These transactions were reported on SEC Form 4s; some Form 4s include the 10b5‑1 checkbox or plan adoption date in their remarks. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000192109425000821/xsl144X01/primary_doc.xml?utm_source=openai))

- Types of transactions commonly shown on Form 4 for NVIDIA insiders (examples from filings): open‑market sales under a preplanned trading plan; shares withheld to cover taxes when restricted shares vest; and routine reporting of exercises or vesting events. Form 4 filings for NVIDIA insiders explicitly list sales and tax‑withholding transactions in multiple entries. ([stocktitan.net](https://www.stocktitan.net/sec-filings/NVDA/form-4-nvidia-corp-insider-trading-activity-23ce6157f6e3.html?utm_source=openai))

- Where these filings are published: Forms 3, 4, and 5 for NVIDIA insiders are filed electronically and are publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR system; media outlets and data aggregators also summarize those filings. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/33-8230.htm?utm_source=openai))

- What a Form 4 shows a reader in plain terms: the date a trade happened, whether shares were bought or sold (or were acquired by vesting or option exercise), the number of shares involved, the insider’s ownership after the trade, and any note saying the trade followed a 10b5‑1 plan. The underlying SEC filing is the primary source for those details. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/compliance-disclosure-interpretations/exchange-act-section-16-related-rules-forms?utm_source=openai))

- Example sources to check for the raw facts (filing documents and company statements):
  - NVIDIA SEC filings (10‑K, proxy statements, and individual Forms 3/4/5) on EDGAR. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))
  - SEC rule and staff guidance on Section 16 and Rule 10b5‑1 (official explanations and the 2023 amendments). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/modernizing-rule-10b5-1-insider-trading-plans?utm_source=openai))
  - Press reports and filing summaries that cite the company’s Form 4s for specific trade dates and share amounts (examples: Barron’s and filing‑summary services). ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sells-stock-757a91d2?utm_source=openai))

## Point 1 - Question 12

**What do competitors, suppliers, former employees, or industry peers say about the integrity of management in regards to shareholders?**

### Research Findings

- In May 2022 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said NVIDIA did not properly tell investors that a big jump in “gaming” revenue was driven in part by crypto-mining, and NVIDIA agreed to pay a $5.5 million penalty without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-79?utm_source=openai))

- Shareholders brought a class-action suit accusing NVIDIA and CEO Jensen Huang of misleading investors about how much sales depended on cryptocurrency; a federal appeals court revived that suit, and the U.S. Supreme Court later let the lower-court decision stand by dismissing NVIDIA’s appeal. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-hear-nvidia-bid-scuttle-shareholder-lawsuit-2024-06-17/?utm_source=openai))

- Lawyers representing the shareholders said their case relied on internal testimony and other evidence alleging that NVIDIA’s public statements were false or reckless; shareholder-side counsel called court decisions allowing the case to proceed a win for corporate accountability. ([usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-12-11/us-supreme-court-tosses-case-involving-securities-fraud-suit-against-nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- In August 2024 some media (reporting The Information’s reporting) said NVIDIA had a late-found design problem that would delay its new “Blackwell” AI chips; that report triggered investor concern and law-firm investigations into whether NVIDIA had fully disclosed relevant facts. ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-03/nvidia-s-new-ai-chip-delayed-due-to-design-flaws-information?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s CEO publicly said the Blackwell chip design issue was fixed, thanked manufacturing partner TSMC for help, and took responsibility for addressing the yield problem as production resumed. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-design-flaw-with-blackwell-ai-chips-now-fixed-ceo-says-2024-10-23/?utm_source=openai))

- A shareholder-rights law firm announced an investigation and invited NVIDIA investors to contact them after media reports of the Blackwell delay, saying the firm was checking whether NVIDIA’s public statements were false or misleading. ([prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nvda-investors-have-opportunity-to-join-nvidia-corporation-fraud-investigation-with-the-schall-law-firm-302215049.html?utm_source=openai))

- Former NVIDIA employees who spoke to reporters describe CEO Jensen Huang’s management style as demanding, focused on high standards, and requiring “intellectual honesty” — they said he presses teams to admit and learn from mistakes. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-leadership-style-insiders-tough-boss-admit-mistakes-2024-6?utm_source=openai))

- On employee-review sites NVIDIA shows high approval ratings for its CEO and generally positive ratings for senior management, alongside comments that the company is fast-moving and that managers often give employees broad responsibility. ([glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NVIDIA-management-Reviews-EI_IE7633.0%2C6_KH7%2C17.htm?utm_source=openai))

- A major industry peer, former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, praised NVIDIA’s execution and leadership under Jensen Huang, saying NVIDIA “is executing well” and that Huang drives his teams to stay at the front of the market. ([benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/04/44960422/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-earns-praise-from-former-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-run-hard-to-stay-in-the-fro?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA suppliers and partners reported close technical cooperation during product issues and large joint projects: for example, TSMC worked with NVIDIA on test runs to address chip yields, and Foxconn and NVIDIA announced a joint AI facility in Taiwan, with supplier executives describing strong demand and collaboration. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-design-flaw-with-blackwell-ai-chips-now-fixed-ceo-says-2024-10-23/?utm_source=openai))

- Independent news outlets and analysts reported that media stories about product delays had moved material investor expectations (for example, analysts, customers, and shareholders reacted publicly when the Blackwell delay was reported).

## Point 1 - Question 13

**Are there consistent reputational indicators of trustworthiness or lack thereof?**

### Research Findings

- Company name and ticker: NVIDIA Corporation, ticker NVDA. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- What the company does: NVIDIA designs high-performance graphics and AI chips (GPUs) and sells related systems and software used by cloud providers, big tech, governments, and companies that run large AI models. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Founder and CEO: Jensen Huang co‑founded NVIDIA in 1993 and has been president and CEO since the company started. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/bios/jensen-huang?utm_source=openai))

- Public filings and where to find them: NVIDIA files regular reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports (Form 10‑K), quarterly reports (Form 10‑Q) and proxy statements (DEF 14A). These filings describe the company’s business, risks, governance and executive pay. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Recent large quarterly result (example): NVIDIA reported revenue of $44.1 billion for the quarter ended April 27, 2025, with data‑center (AI) revenue of $39.1 billion. (This is an example of the company’s scale and recent performance.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Export‑control impact (April–May 2025): In April 2025 the U.S. government told NVIDIA that exports of certain H20 chips to China require a license. NVIDIA said this led to a large charge (reported as $4.5 billion in Q1 fiscal 2026) for excess H20 inventory and lost sales. The company disclosed the licensing requirement and related charges in SEC filings and its earnings release. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000082/nvda-20250409.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Customers and market position: Major cloud and AI companies (for example, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and many AI labs) use NVIDIA GPUs and partner with NVIDIA to build AI infrastructure, making NVIDIA a central supplier for large AI workloads. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/aws-nvidia-strategic-collaboration-for-generative-ai?utm_source=openai))

- Supply chain model: NVIDIA is “fabless”: it designs chips but uses outside foundries and contractors (for example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, TSMC) to manufacture and package chips. NVIDIA’s SEC filings list reliance on third parties for manufacturing, assembly and testing as a business risk. ([cdn.yahoofinance.com](https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-filings/0001045810/000104581022000166/nvda-20221030.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Production and yield issues (example): NVIDIA reported a design flaw that affected yields on its Blackwell chips in 2024; the company worked with TSMC to fix the problem and said the flaw was NVIDIA’s responsibility. Such production or yield problems can delay shipments. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-design-flaw-with-blackwell-ai-chips-now-fixed-ceo-says-2024-10-23/?utm_source=openai))

- Cybersecurity incident (March 2022): A hacking group known as Lapsus$ claimed to have stolen and leaked NVIDIA data in early 2022. NVIDIA confirmed an intrusion, said it engaged cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, and said it did not expect business disruption. The leak included some employee account information and proprietary files, according to reporting. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/nvidia-hackers-leak-ransomware/?utm_source=openai))

- Trade‑secret / employee confidentiality case (2025): In 2025 Reuters reported a trade‑secrets lawsuit (Valeo v. NVIDIA) that was set to go to trial after a judge allowed a jury to decide whether NVIDIA benefited from stolen information shown by a former employee who joined NVIDIA. The case concerns whether confidential documents from the prior employer were used. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/nvidia-worker-shares-secrets-his-screen-legal-battle-erupts-2025-09-02/?utm_source=openai))

- Antitrust and regulatory scrutiny (U.S. and China, 2024–2025): NVIDIA has faced multiple probes and investigations. U.S. authorities (Department of Justice) reported probes into possible anticompetitive practices; Chinese regulators (State Administration for Market Regulation) opened an investigation related to NVIDIA’s 2020 Mellanox acquisition and compliance with merger conditions. These are matters reported by major news outlets. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/nvidia-shares-fall-after-report-that-it-faces-a-us-doj-antitrust-probe.html?utm_source=openai))

- History of merger activity and regulator reactions: NVIDIA completed its acquisition of Mellanox in April 2020 after receiving approvals. Separately, NVIDIA announced a proposed acquisition of Arm in 2020 but abandoned that plan in 2022 after extensive regulatory opposition. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-completes-acquisition-of-mellanox-creating-major-force-driving-next-gen-data-centers/?utm_source=openai))

- Securities class‑action litigation (ongoing history): Investors have filed and pursued class‑action claims against NVIDIA at various times; for example, a long‑running investor suit that originated in 2019 was allowed to proceed after the Supreme Court declined to grant NVIDIA further review in December 2024. Law firms have also announced investigations into particular disclosures and news items. ([usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-12-11/supreme-court-allows-investors-class-action-to-proceed-against-microchip-company-nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- Public reputation and rankings (examples): Fortune’s “World’s Most Admired Companies” list ranked NVIDIA highly in 2024–2025 (NVIDIA rose into the top ranks in those years). Glassdoor has ranked NVIDIA on employee‑leadership and “best‑led” lists (Glassdoor named NVIDIA highly in 2025). These are third‑party reputation indicators from surveys and rankings. ([fortune.com](https://fortune.com/ranking/worlds-most-admired-companies/2025/?utm_source=openai))

- Employee metrics (turnover / tenure – company disclosure): NVIDIA reports on employee demographics and tenure in its sustainability and proxy reports; the company has said many employees have long tenure and that it ranks well on workplace lists. For details, see NVIDIA’s sustainability pages and proxy filings. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/sustainability/?utm_source=openai))

- Environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting: NVIDIA publishes annual sustainability reports and posts ESG information on its website, including energy and climate goals (for example, statements about renewable electricity and product energy efficiency). Independent ESG vendors publish ratings, but those ratings come from different methodologies and may be behind paywalls. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/sustainability/?utm_source=openai))

- Financial disclosure practices: NVIDIA regularly discloses material events, risk factors and charges in SEC filings (10‑K, 10‑Q, 8‑K). Big, one‑time items (for example the H20 licensing charge in 2025) were reported in 8‑K/earnings statements and discussed in quarterly reports. Investors use these filings to check transparency and timeliness of disclosures. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000082/nvda-20250409.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Noted business risks from filings: NVIDIA’s SEC filings list key risks that affect trust assessments, including dependence on a small number of product lines, reliance on third‑party manufacturers, geopolitical and export controls, competition, and potential legal or regulatory actions. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Example of product impact from export controls: U.S. export rules in 2023–2025 restricted sales of some advanced NVIDIA chips to China; those rules and related licensing requirements have led to lost sales, inventory charges and public comments from NVIDIA’s CEO about market effects. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html?utm_source=openai))

- Partnerships and ecosystem: NVIDIA has formal partnerships and product integrations with major cloud providers and server makers, and it sells reference designs and systems (DGX, HGX, partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, server ODMs) so its technology is broadly embedded in the AI ecosystem. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/aws-nvidia-strategic-collaboration-for-generative-ai?utm_source=openai))

- Where to read primary source facts: For official company statements and financial numbers, consult NVIDIA’s investor relations site and SEC filings (press releases, Form 10‑K, Form 8‑K, DEF 14A). For regulatory and legal developments, consult major news outlets and Reuters/CNBC/AP reporting cited above.

### Point 2 Criterion

Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

## Point 2 - Question 1

**Is the projected sales growth a short-term phenomenon, or can it be sustained for more than just a few years? You must distinguish desirable long-term growth from a one-time profit or a sales increase that lasts only for a few years.**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA total revenue for fiscal year 2025 (year ended Jan 26, 2025): $130.497 billion, up 114% from the prior year. Data-center and related Compute & Networking revenue made up the large majority of the company’s sales: Compute & Networking = $116.193 billion of $130.497 billion. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Data‑center revenue grew very quickly in 2025: the company reported Data Center (part of Compute & Networking) growth of roughly 142% year‑over‑year for the fiscal year, and record quarterly Data Center revenues in multiple quarters of FY2025 and FY2026. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s business mix is heavily skewed to hardware for AI data centers (GPUs, systems, networking). In fiscal 2025, Compute & Networking accounted for about 89% of total revenue (116,193 / 130,497). Graphics and other segments were much smaller. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company’s reported deferred revenue and contract obligations (money received in advance for future software, support, or long‑term hardware contracts) are relatively small compared with total sales: deferred revenue additions were $5.083 billion in FY2025 and revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts >1 year was about $1.7 billion as of Jan 26, 2025. This shows most revenue is recognized at or near product delivery, not locked in multi‑year recurring contracts. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA reported and disclosed specific charges and inventory impacts tied to H20 chips for China: the company recorded a multi‑billion dollar charge (company filings and public statements referenced a $4.5 billion charge and media reported a possible $5.5 billion charge/reserve) after U.S. export‑licensing changes affected H20 shipments to China. These items affected one quarter’s results and inventory balances. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The U.S. export control rules and licensing requirements (described in NVIDIA’s SEC filings) limit shipping of certain high‑performance chips to China and other listed country groups unless a license is granted. NVIDIA states these rules have already affected its ability to ship some products and may continue to affect future sales to affected markets. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA names large cloud service providers, hyperscalers, and big internet companies as key customers and partners. Company releases and filings note major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave and others) are adopting NVIDIA systems, and the company has large direct customer concentrations where a few customers each represented about 10–12% of revenue in FY2025. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA sells both chips and integrated systems (DGX, HGX, GB200/Blackwell systems, etc.). The company announced and began shipping Blackwell‑based systems in late FY2025 and continued to roll out follow‑on platforms (GB200, Rubin, etc.), which are designed for very large AI models and can command higher prices than earlier chips. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company’s revenue and profit margins rose as the mix shifted toward higher‑margin data‑center products; gross margin for FY2025 was about 75.0%, higher than the prior year, driven largely by the Data Center mix. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA relies on third‑party foundries and suppliers for chip manufacturing and packaging. The 10‑K names TSMC and Samsung as wafer foundries and lists CoWoS packaging and several contract manufacturers for assembly/testing. This means NVIDIA depends on external factory capacity and lead times. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s software and developer ecosystem (CUDA, CUDA‑X libraries, Omniverse, AI Enterprise, and other tools) is large and widely used by developers and researchers; recent company materials cite a developer community measured in the millions and thousands of CUDA‑compatible applications, which supports software‑level lock‑in for customers using NVIDIA hardware and tools. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Unveils-Rubin-CPX-A-New-Class-of-GPU-Designed-for-Massive-Context-Inference/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The company discloses customer concentration risk: in FY2025 a small number of direct customers each represented roughly 10–12% of revenue, and the company notes it has experienced periods where a limited number of customers account for a large share of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s SEC filings and press releases explicitly list main competitors and potential substitutes in AI compute: AMD, Intel, Huawei, and other incumbent and startup AI accelerator vendors, and they warn competition and new entrants could affect market share. NVIDIA also warns large cloud providers could develop their own hardware. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Independent analysts and financial media provide large estimates for the size of the AI infrastructure market and some high‑growth scenarios for NVIDIA: examples include Citi forecasting big increases in hyperscaler AI spending, and some analysts projecting very large TAMs and multi‑year growth trajectories for AI infrastructure where NVIDIA could capture a substantial share. These are external market estimates and analyst forecasts, not company financial statements. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA reported large short‑term orders and demand signals from Chinese internet firms for H20 chips (media reported orders in the tens of billions of dollars range in early 2025), which created short‑term revenue spikes before export licensing interruptions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-firms-place-16-billion-order-new-nvidia-chips-information-reports-2025-04-02/?utm_source=openai))

- The company reported provisions and releases related to inventory and purchase obligations (inventory provisions totaled about $3.7 billion for FY2025, with some prior reserves released when previously reserved inventory was sold), indicating inventory and short‑term order timing can materially move reported gross margin and results. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA discloses deferred revenue related to hardware support, software support, and license and development arrangements; as of Jan 26, 2025 the balance of deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations indicates some multiyear contracted revenue exists, but the dollar amounts are small versus total annual sales. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA notes regulatory, export‑control, and geopolitical risks in its filings as possible constraints on future sales to certain countries; the company warns these risks could lead to inability to sell products in some markets or require product redesigns, which could reduce near‑term or longer‑term revenue from those markets. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Company disclosures show operating expenses and R&D spending increased materially in FY2025 (R&D and SG&A rose with hiring and new product development), indicating the company is investing heavily in new products and software that would be required to sustain long‑term growth. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Public news reports documented at least one large, time‑limited effect on sales: big H20 order volumes from Chinese firms in early 2025 produced a near‑term revenue surge but were affected later by licensing changes and inventory reserves; this is an example of a concentrated, region‑specific order wave that was not guaranteed to continue. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-firms-place-16-billion-order-new-nvidia-chips-information-reports-2025-04-02/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s disclosures show some revenue comes from multi‑year agreements and customer advances (customer advances of $3.6 billion added in FY2025), but most fiscal 2025 revenue was recognized on shipment/delivery rather than spread as multi‑year recurring revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company has announced partnerships and large customer initiatives (for example, public announcements about GB200 systems being brought into cloud providers’ regions and involvement in large projects described in company releases), which create large sale opportunities but are linked to hyperscalers’ capital spending plans. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Historical precedent: NVIDIA and the semiconductor industry have experienced previous short‑term demand spikes tied to specific end‑markets (for example, prior crypto‑mining cycles affected GPU demand in past years). Company filings and industry reports show that some market booms can be temporary and cause volatile channel inventory and sales patterns. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/4-key-takeaways-from-nvidia-q4-fy2024-earnings-call-8598375?utm_source=openai))

- The company warns in its SEC filings that changes in the U.S. government export rules, or other regulations, could further limit its ability to sell certain products in parts of the world and materially harm sales in those regions. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Analysts and several media outlets have published very large multi‑year upside scenarios for NVIDIA based on broad adoption of generative AI, with estimates ranging from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars of potential AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. These are analyst scenarios and should be read as market forecasts, not company promises. ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-1-trillion-annual-revenue-749a90b5?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s FY2025 financial statements and public filings (10‑K and quarterly releases) are the primary sources for the revenue, segment, margin, customer concentration, deferred revenue, inventory provision, and export‑control disclosure facts above. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

## Point 2 - Question 2

**Is the company’s growth reliant on a single product spurt, or does its management have a history of developing new product lines to create continuous growth? The best results are found in companies where growth happens in a series of more or less continuous spurts, instead of a single, isolated spurt of growth.**

## Point 2 - Question 3

**Can the company be categorized as “fortunate and able”? This identifies if a company has the high degree of skill needed to capitalize on favorable background conditions and new markets that arise from influences completely beyond its own control.**

### Research Findings

- Company name and ticker: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker: NVDA). Founded April 5, 1993. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California. CEO and co‑founder: Jensen Huang. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- What the company makes (simple): NVIDIA designs powerful computer chips called GPUs. These chips are used for video games, for big computer centers that run artificial intelligence (AI), for robots and self‑driving cars, and for software that simulates 3D worlds. NVIDIA designs the chips but does not build the silicon factories itself (it is a “fabless” chip designer). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- Revenue and size (recent): For fiscal year 2025 (year ended Jan 26, 2025) NVIDIA reported total revenue of $130.5 billion. Quarterly and product figures showed very large sales from data‑center products. In Q4 FY2025, total revenue was $39.3 billion and Data Center revenue was $35.6 billion. NVIDIA reported continued growth into fiscal 2026, with Q1 FY2026 revenue of $44.1 billion. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Data‑center (AI) business concentration: A very large share of NVIDIA’s recent sales comes from data‑center GPUs used to train and run AI models. NVIDIA reported full‑year Data Center revenue of about $115.2 billion for FY2025 (company statements list large proportions of overall revenue coming from this segment). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Market value (example snapshot): Public market sources show NVIDIA’s market capitalization in early October 2025 at roughly $4.5 trillion (market value changes daily with the stock price; this is a snapshot near Oct 2025). ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/market-cap/?utm_source=openai))

- Market position in AI GPUs: Industry estimates in 2024–mid‑2025 placed NVIDIA as the dominant supplier of high‑performance GPUs for AI training and inference. Estimates commonly put NVIDIA’s share in the core AI‑GPU / accelerator market in the range of roughly 70%–95%, with many analysts and market studies describing NVIDIA as the market leader by a wide margin. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html?utm_source=openai))

- Software and developer ecosystem (why it matters): NVIDIA created CUDA, a software platform that lets programmers run general computing tasks on GPUs. CUDA was publicly released in 2007 and became widely used for AI and scientific code. Over time NVIDIA built libraries and tools (CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc.) so many AI researchers and companies write and tune their code for NVIDIA GPUs. This creates switching costs for users who would move to other hardware. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA?utm_source=openai))

- Developer community size (examples): NVIDIA’s public statements and industry reporting show large developer and user communities. Company and press reporting marked past milestones such as ~2 million registered developers (2020) and industry reports in 2025 referenced an NVIDIA developer ecosystem on the order of millions (Reuters cited an industry estimate of about 5 million developers in May 2025). ([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/celebrating-the-2-million-innovators-changing-the-world/?utm_source=openai))

- Recent export controls and impact (China): In April 2025 the U.S. government told NVIDIA that some of its H20‑class chips require an export license to be sent to China. NVIDIA disclosed a multi‑billion‑dollar charge related to H20 inventory and commitments as a result. The company’s SEC filings and public statements explain the license requirement and the related financial charge taken in fiscal 2026 reporting. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Example of regulatory/market risk detail: NVIDIA’s SEC filing (filed after the April 2025 notice) reports the U.S. government required a license for H20 exports and explains the company recognized charges tied to diminished demand for those products in affected markets. The export rules target chips above certain performance thresholds. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Notable acquisitions and building blocks: NVIDIA has made acquisitions to add networking and systems capabilities (for example, Mellanox Technologies in 2020 and other software and systems acquisitions) to expand beyond pure GPU design into systems and networking used in data centers. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- Public milestones affecting investors: NVIDIA executed a ten‑for‑one stock split effective June 7, 2024, and has repeatedly reported record quarters and fiscal years through 2024–2025 driven by AI demand for its data‑center products. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

- Examples of concrete financial charges or inventory actions (illustrating downside events): NVIDIA’s public filings and earnings commentary in 2025 show the company recorded substantial charges tied to H20 inventory and expects U.S. export licensing rules to affect sales into certain markets; analysts and news outlets reported this as a measurable short‑term revenue impact. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

## Point 2 - Question 6

**If the company is in an industry subject to technological change, is the management team adept at using these changes to create future growth opportunities? Outstanding management in a technological industry can leverage its skills to build up sizable new businesses.**

### Research Findings

- Jensen Huang is the company’s co-founder and has been its president and chief executive officer since 1993. He leads product and strategy decisions. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The company was originally built to make fast graphics chips for video games. Over time management moved the same chip ideas into scientific and business computing. That change started to be formalized when the company opened its GPU chips to general-purpose computing with a technology called CUDA in 2006. CUDA lets programmers use the company’s graphics chips to do many kinds of heavy number-crunching, not just draw images. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/?utm_source=openai))

- Management built a large software and developer program around the chips (examples: CUDA libraries and toolkits, the NVIDIA Inception startup program, NGC catalog, Omniverse platform, and NIM microservices). These software pieces make it easier for customers and developers to use the company’s chips for AI, simulation, and other tasks. ([docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.9.0/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html?utm_source=openai))

- Over recent years the company shifted sales away from personal graphics toward data-center and AI products. For fiscal year 2025 the company reported total revenue of about $130.5 billion and said data-center sales were $115.2 billion for that year (data-center became the largest part of sales). Quarterly results in 2025 show continuing very large data-center revenue (for example, $39.1 billion in one 2025 quarter). These financial figures show management’s moves produced large growth in the data-center business. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Management created and sells integrated systems (for customers who need big AI computing setups) such as DGX servers and whole-rack systems, and it works with cloud providers to put those systems into public clouds. The company’s 2024–2025 announcements list partnerships with major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and others) bringing the company’s systems into cloud regions. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Management has grown the company’s technology by buying other firms with skills it needed. Notable deals and timing include: Mellanox (networking gear) announced March 2019 and closed April 2020; Run:ai (AI infrastructure orchestration) announced 2024 and cleared EU approval December 2024; and a series of 2024 acquisitions of AI software startups (examples reported: OctoAI/OctoML and others). These buys added networking, software, and AI tooling to the company’s hardware. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion/?utm_source=openai))

- The company describes building full “stack” solutions: chips plus networking plus software plus ready systems and cloud services. Public company releases and product announcements from 2024–2025 (examples: Blackwell platform, Omniverse expansions, NIM microservices, and DGX/DGX SuperPOD systems) show the management team pushes products that combine hardware and software together for customers building AI services. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Management has reported and promoted an active developer and partner ecosystem: the company’s own materials say millions of developers use its tools, thousands of companies participate in its programs, and many independent software vendors build on its platforms (for example, the Inception startup program and Omniverse partners named in company releases). This ecosystem helps other firms adopt the company’s technology more easily. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/?utm_source=openai))

- The company’s public filings list the senior leaders who run finance, operations, field sales and legal functions (examples: Colette Kress, EVP and CFO; Debora Shoquist, EVP Operations; Ajay Puri, EVP Worldwide Field Operations; Tim Teter, EVP and General Counsel). Those executives have been named in the company’s Form 10-K and leadership pages. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Regulators and reporters have noted increased scrutiny of the company’s acquisitions and market position in AI hardware and software. Some acquisitions and the company’s market role have drawn regulatory review in the EU and other places. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/fa7a2e35-df03-45a1-bd0b-3f7207a7d84b?utm_source=openai))

- Recent public announcements (2024–2025) show management continuing to introduce new chip generations and new system products aimed specifically at large AI models and inference workloads (examples include the Blackwell platform and Rubin/GB200 systems mentioned in company releases and industry reports). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

## Point 2 - Question 7

**Is the company a key supplier to a growing industry? Sometimes the most successful producer and best investment is not the maker of the end-product, but a technically proficient supplier of a key component seeing “a major source of new business”.**

### Research Findings

- Company name and ticker: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker: NVDA). NVIDIA designs and sells graphics processors (GPUs), networking products, software, and full systems for computing. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Main product lines (simple): GeForce GPUs for PC gaming; data‑center GPUs and systems for artificial intelligence and large computing jobs (examples: A100, H100, Hopper and Blackwell architectures, DGX systems); networking and interconnect products; software tools and libraries (CUDA and related toolkits); automotive systems (DRIVE). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Hopper-GPUs-Expand-Reach-as-Demand-for-AI-Grows/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Fiscal year 2025 sales: total revenue was $130.497 billion. Data Center sales were $115.186 billion of that total. This means most of the company’s money in that year came from its data‑center products. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Data Center growth detail: Data Center revenue rose strongly year over year and the company says that demand for its Hopper‑generation products and early Blackwell systems drove the increase. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Market share in data‑center GPUs (industry study): a 2023 industry analysis reported NVIDIA shipped about 3.76 million data‑center GPUs in 2023 and estimated NVIDIA had roughly 98% of data‑center GPU shipments and revenue that year. (This is an industry analyst report cited by technical news outlets.) ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))

- Cloud and service providers use NVIDIA GPUs: major cloud providers offer virtual machines and services that run on NVIDIA H100/H200 and A100 GPUs (examples: AWS P5 instances with H100; Microsoft Azure NC/ND H100 VM series; Google Cloud A3 supercomputers with H100). These cloud machines are used by companies to train and run large AI models without buying hardware themselves. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p5/?utm_source=openai))

- Large AI customers and users: NVIDIA and its public materials note that leading AI labs and companies have used NVIDIA data‑center GPUs (for example, OpenAI used A100s historically), and OpenAI and NVIDIA announced a strategic compute partnership in 2025 to deploy very large amounts of NVIDIA systems. These customers run big AI model training and inference on NVIDIA hardware. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Hopper-GPUs-Expand-Reach-as-Demand-for-AI-Grows/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Software and developer ecosystem (simple): NVIDIA’s CUDA platform is a set of software tools developers use to make programs run faster on NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA says many GPUs and many developer tool downloads exist for CUDA, and it offers additional AI microservices and libraries that run on CUDA‑enabled hardware. This software makes it easier for companies and researchers to use NVIDIA chips. ([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone?%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3F%3FCUDA=&utm_source=openai))

- Manufacturing model (simple): NVIDIA designs chips but does not own large semiconductor factories. It outsources chip manufacturing to foundry companies such as TSMC. News reports and company materials show NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC capacity to make its advanced GPUs. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/25/tsmc-asml-two-critical-chip-firms-rally-after-nvidias-earnings.html?utm_source=openai))

- Revenue concentration (simple): NVIDIA’s filings show that, in the most recent fiscal year, a small number of direct customers each accounted for double‑digit percentages of total revenue (examples in the filing listed as roughly 12%, 11%, and 11% for three named direct customers). These large customers are primarily in the Compute & Networking (data‑center) part of the business. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Company statement on addressable markets (simple): NVIDIA’s annual report describes its focus on four large markets where its platforms are used: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. It says the Data Center market, driven by AI model training and inference, was the main driver of recent revenue growth. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

### Point 3 Criterion

Does the company have an above-average sales organization?

## Point 3 - Question 1

**How does the company’s sales, advertising, and distribution efficiency compare to that of its key competitors?**

### Research Findings

NVIDIA (ticker NVDA) — fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025
- Revenue (FY2025): $130,497 million. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Sales, general and administrative (SG&A): $3,491 million, which is 2.7% of revenue. (This is the company’s selling and marketing plus general administrative spending reported in the 10‑K.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Advertising: NVIDIA’s filing does not report a separate “advertising” line; marketing and related costs are included inside SG&A. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Accounts receivable, net: $23,065 million. That amount equals about 64.5 days of sales on average (accounts receivable ÷ annual revenue × 365 = 23,065 ÷ 130,497 × 365 ≈ 64.5 days). (This measures how long customers take, on average, to pay NVIDIA.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Inventories: $10,080 million. That inventory level equals about 112.8 days of cost of goods sold on hand (inventories ÷ cost of goods sold × 365 = 10,080 ÷ 32,639 × 365 ≈ 112.8 days). (This shows how many days of product NVIDIA holds before selling.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Employees: ~36,000 total employees. Revenue per employee ≈ $3.63 million (revenue ÷ employees = 130,497 ÷ 36,000 ≈ $3.63M). (Revenue per employee is a simple measure of how much sales each worker, on average, produces.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Example of recent base-salary action: For fiscal 2025 the CC increased CEO Jensen Huang’s base salary from about $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 (a 50% increase), noting it was his first base-salary increase in about ten years; many other named executive officers’ base salaries were reported as unchanged for that fiscal year. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- Elements considered when setting pay: The CC describes total target pay as the sum of (1) annual base salary, (2) target variable cash opportunity under the Variable Cash Plan, and (3) target equity opportunity; the CC compares those totals to peer-company data when setting targets. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

- Exceptions to the annual cycle: The proxy notes that the CC may grant equity awards outside the annual March cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000095/nvda-20250512.htm))

## Point 5 - Question 5

**Does executive management avoid bringing in outsiders for roles beyond entry-level positions unless there is no qualified internal candidate available?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s 2025 proxy statement says the board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) “identifies, reviews, and evaluates candidates” for the board and handles board recruiting. The proxy does not set out a rule that senior jobs must go to internal candidates. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- NVIDIA’s public executive biography for Colette Kress says she joined NVIDIA as CFO in September 2013 after nearly 25 years at other large technology companies (Cisco, Microsoft, Texas Instruments). This is an example of an outside hire for a top executive role. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/governance/management-team/colette-kress//?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public executive biography for Debora Shoquist says she joined NVIDIA in 2007 from other firms (JDS Uniphase, Coherent, Quantum, HP) and later became Executive Vice President of Operations. This is another example of an outside executive hire who rose to a senior role. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/governance/management-team/debora-shoquist/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has publicly named outside leaders to its board of directors (for example, Ellen Ochoa was named to NVIDIA’s board on November 7, 2024). This shows the company brings external people into senior governance roles. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Names-Ellen-Ochoa-to-Board-of-Directors/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Multiple news reports note that NVIDIA’s CEO structure centers on founder Jensen Huang and that the company has not publicly named a clear successor; journalists and governance observers have said the company does not have a publicly disclosed, named CEO successor or a detailed succession plan. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-stephen-witt-thinking-machine-book-biography-2025-4?utm_source=openai))

- Reuters reported in September 2025 that NVIDIA spent more than $900 million to hire the CEO and other personnel from the startup Enfabrica and to license its technology—an example of NVIDIA paying to bring external senior technical talent into the company. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-spent-over-900-million-hire-enfabrica-ceo-license-technology-cnbc-reports-2025-09-18/?utm_source=openai))

## Point 5 - Question 6

**Does top management acknowledge the inevitability of some factionalism and interpersonal friction, but refuse to tolerate individuals who disrupt team cooperation, thereby minimizing such issues?**

### Research Findings

- Jensen Huang (NVIDIA’s CEO) has said in public talks that he prefers to help people improve instead of firing them; he has been quoted saying he’d “rather improve you than give up on you” and joking that he would “torture you into greatness.” ([livemint.com](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/nvidia-jensen-huang-doesnt-fire-people-cleaned-bathrooms-now-ceo-can-learn-need-opportunity-torture-you-into-greatness-11718165859454.html?utm_source=openai))

- Huang runs a very flat, hands-on management style: he has many direct reports, says “the mission is the boss,” and openly gives feedback in group settings so everyone hears it at once. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-management-leadership-advice-how-to-run-business-2024-6?utm_source=openai))

- Former and current employees told reporters (Bloomberg and others) that NVIDIA meetings can be intense and sometimes include shouting or fights; several people described a “pressure‑cooker” environment with long hours and heated meetings. ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-employees-often-seven-days-193653866.html?utm_source=openai))

- Reported comments from former staff and company observers say Jensen Huang “doesn’t tolerate bullshit” or self‑serving behavior; observers describe a culture that calls out people who act against the company mission. ([politicalriskwire.com](https://politicalriskwire.com/nvidias-hardcore-culture-how-ceo-jensen-huang-drives-accountability/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s official codes of conduct (for conferences and open‑source projects) explicitly forbid harassment, bullying, and sustained disruption; they say organizers will enforce rules and may warn, remove, or bar people who violate the rules. The company provides ways to report incidents and investigates complaints. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/code-of-conduct/?utm_source=openai))

### Point 6 Criterion

Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?

## Point 6 - Question 1

**Does the company experience frequent or prolonged strikes or other major work stoppages?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s public filings and legal agreements state that, to the company’s knowledge, it is not party to any collective bargaining (union) agreements and, in the recent years covered by those documents, the company reported no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts or similar labor actions affecting its business. ([content.edgar-online.com](https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0001045810-19-000031.html?dest=ex21mergeragreement_htm&hash=4a95f3b3546ebf5e02371d68f0fbb1c3e6552ac4bd3626dbd16d10568789e96a&utm_source=openai))

- In legal and merger-related disclosures NVIDIA has said there were no threatened or pending labor-organizing petitions or representation disputes involving its employees during the past several years covered by those filings. ([content.edgar-online.com](https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0001045810-19-000031.html?dest=ex21mergeragreement_htm&hash=4a95f3b3546ebf5e02371d68f0fbb1c3e6552ac4bd3626dbd16d10568789e96a&utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s SEC filings and investor documents state the company relies on third parties (contract manufacturers and foundries) to manufacture, assemble, package and test its chips and products. This means NVIDIA’s supply and production can be affected by labor actions at its suppliers. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000124/nvda-20240428.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Major suppliers in the semiconductor supply chain have experienced strikes. For example, Samsung Electronics had a multi-day strike by semiconductor-related workers in July 2024; such supplier strikes can affect companies that buy chips or memory from those suppliers. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/62d4cbe1-6c0f-4803-99e1-4233b8b8eb87?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA uses outside foundries such as TSMC for chip manufacturing and has publicly discussed TSMC as a key manufacturing/packaging partner; disruptions at those foundries (for any reason, including labor disputes) could affect NVIDIA’s product supply. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-orders-300000-h20-chips-tsmc-due-robust-china-demand-sources-say-2025-07-29/?utm_source=openai))

(text from NVIDIA transaction/merger disclosures). ([contracts.justia.com](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/nvidia-corporation-978/contract/128612/?utm_source=openai))

- Employee compensation program (company statements): NVIDIA says it gives employees equity awards (stock or stock-like grants) except where local rules prevent that, and those equity awards vest over time as part of pay and retention. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000080/nvda-20230508.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Median pay / pay statistics reported in company filings and media: NVIDIA’s public proxy filing for an earlier year reported a median employee annual compensation of about $228,078 (fiscal 2023, per the company’s proxy disclosure).

- Pay-parity and third‑party review (company statements): NVIDIA says it uses an independent, third‑party firm to analyze pay and promotion practices and reported it had achieved “pay parity” (no statistically significant differences in pay by gender, race, or ethnicity) in the years described in its filings. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Benefits and workplace programs (company statements): NVIDIA’s filings list benefits and programs including 401(k) and statutory pensions (where required outside the U.S.), an employee stock purchase program, tuition reimbursement, career coaching and mentoring programs, mental‑health and well‑being supports, a hybrid/ flexible work approach, a quarterly company “rest days” policy, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third‑party reporting platform. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000080/nvda-20230508.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Workforce composition (company statements): NVIDIA’s filings state the workforce is heavily technical (about 82% technical in the 2025 filing) and that a large share of employees hold advanced degrees. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Company statements about employee engagement and development: NVIDIA’s public filings describe training, learning paths, internal mobility, and promotion programs used to develop and retain employees. The filings say the company uses pulse surveys and other channels to measure employee sentiment. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

## Point 6 - Question 3

**How does the company’s labor-turnover rate compare with local or industry peers? Is there evidence of an unusually large pool of applicants seeking employment at the company?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA reported an overall employee turnover (annual attrition) rate of 2.7% for fiscal 2024 (fiscal year ended January 28, 2024). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm))

- NVIDIA reported an overall employee turnover (annual attrition) rate of 2.5% for fiscal 2025 (fiscal year ended January 26, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- NVIDIA’s workforce size at the end of fiscal 2025 was about 36,000 employees, with about 27,100 in research & development and 8,900 in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative roles.

## Point 6 - Question 6

**Does top management show a consistent sense of responsibility toward ordinary employees—for example, by avoiding mass layoffs prompted solely by short-term profit swings and by fostering dignity and inclusion in the workplace?**

### Research Findings

Search date: October 7, 2025.

Facts (each line is a single factual item; sources are listed at the end of that item):

- Nvidia’s headcount grew substantially from 2020 to 2025. 2020 ≈ 13,775 employees; 2023 ≈ 26,196; 2024 ≈ 29,600; fiscal 2025 ≈ 36,000. ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/employees/?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s public annual reports and 10‑K filings describe the company as hiring many technical staff; in fiscal 2024 the company said about 22,200 employees worked in research and development and 7,400 in sales/operations; in fiscal 2025 the filing reported about 27,100 in R&D and 8,900 in sales/operations. ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/BC239FE0177447E4FEEA5C8C389B6E280A4BAD98?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s public filings and investor materials say the company uses restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs) to pay and retain staff. The company’s standard RSU vesting schedules include multi‑year schedules (commonly a four‑year pattern with ~25% after one year then quarterly vesting). PSUs also typically vest over multi‑year schedules. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/R13.htm?utm_source=openai))

- In April 2024 Nvidia gave employees an extra equity award reported in the press as a one‑time “special Jensen grant” worth an additional ~25% of annual equity refreshers; reports said the extra awards were scheduled to vest over four years. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-stock-boost-employees-special-grant-2024-4?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s public statements about acquisitions have included explicit promises about jobs. When Nvidia bought Mellanox in 2020, company leadership publicly said they did not plan layoffs at Mellanox and intended to keep employees. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/invest-in-mellanox/?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s long history includes at least one early, large staff reduction: public histories note that in 1996 Jensen Huang cut more than half of the company’s staff (reducing headcount from ~100 to ~40) as part of a business turnaround. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s 2024 and 2025 public reports and its careers/diversity pages state commitments to diversity, inclusion, and “pay parity.” The company lists programs such as employee resource groups, external partnerships with diversity organizations, diversity recruiting efforts, manager training, and tracking of parity in retention, promotions and pay. The company’s public pages say it has “achieved pay parity for the past several years.” ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/about-nvidia/careers/diversity-and-inclusion/?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s public filings and reports provide workforce demographic numbers. For example, the company reported in fiscal 2024 roughly 79% male, 20% female, 1% not declared globally, and reported that about 6% of its U.S. workforce identified as Black or Hispanic/Latino. ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/BC239FE0177447E4FEEA5C8C389B6E280A4BAD98?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia publicly describes a flexible work approach and employee wellbeing policies in filings and reports. For example, the company’s filings and FY reports mention flexible work options and company time‑off policies (the 10‑K and related reports reference programs to support balance and employee recharge days). ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/BC239FE0177447E4FEEA5C8C389B6E280A4BAD98?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s corporate foundation and volunteer programs have high employee participation numbers in recent years. FY24 and FY25 foundation reports say tens of thousands of volunteer hours and sizable employee donation and matching programs (for example, FY24: ~40% employee participation and ~$16M donated; FY25: ~35% participation and larger totals reported). ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/es-la/foundation/reports/?utm_source=openai))

- External employee review sites and employer‑ranking lists show strong employee ratings for Nvidia in recent years. Glassdoor listings and Nvidia’s press posts cite high overall ratings, high CEO approval scores, and placements on Glassdoor “best” lists (e.g., Glassdoor Best Employers and Best‑Led Companies). Glassdoor category scores cited on public pages include strong marks for culture, pay, and diversity. ([glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NVIDIA-work-life-balance-Reviews-EI_IE7633.0%2C6_KH7%2C24.htm?utm_source=openai))

- News and company reports from 2023–2025 show Nvidia expanding hiring in some regions (for example, additional hires in China in 2024) even while facing regulatory scrutiny in some markets; Reuters reported Nvidia hiring in Beijing in 2024 and noted an investigation in China about competition concerns. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-steps-up-hiring-china-focus-ai-driven-cars-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-12-12/?utm_source=openai))

- I searched public news archives, Nvidia’s filings, NLRB summaries, and major labor‑organizing campaign trackers through October 7, 2025 and did not find major, widely reported union‑certification votes, large‑scale NLRB unfair‑labor‑practice cases, or major public labor strikes listing Nvidia as the employer through that date. (This is a statement about what public records and news articles showed in the searches I ran.) ([nlrb.gov](https://www.nlrb.gov/cases-decisions/weekly-summaries-decisions/summary-of-nlrb-decisions-for-week-of-october-21-25-2024?utm_source=openai))

- Public interviews and news stories record comments by Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang about employee management. Huang has been quoted saying he prefers to develop employees rather than fire them and has used phrases reported in multiple outlets (for example, variations of “I don’t like giving up on people” and “I’d rather ‘torture them into greatness’” in public remarks and interviews). ([benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/09/40692021/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-will-push-employees-to-their-limits-but-is-reluctant-to-let-them-go-ill-tort?utm_source=openai))

### Point 7 Criterion

Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits?

## Point 7 - Question 1

**Does the company consistently seek the lowest possible price from vendors, or are there documented instances in which it is willing to pay above-contract costs in order to keep a dependable supply chain and build goodwill for the future?**

### Research Findings

- In NVIDIA’s public SEC filings (10‑K and 10‑Q), the company says it "has paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity." ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000124/nvda-20240428.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s filings show a line item called "Prepaid supply and capacity agreements" of about $2.9 billion on the balance sheet (for example, $2,927 million as of October 29, 2023). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000227/nvda-20231029.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s quarterly notes state the company "places non‑cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times" and that doing so can increase product costs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA disclosed specific charges related to these supply commitments: in one quarter it recorded roughly $473 million, and in another quarter roughly $348 million, in cost of revenue for inventory purchase obligations in excess of demand, supplier charges and penalties for cancellations or under‑utilization. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000227/nvda-20231029.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Multiple industry press reports from late December 2023 say NVIDIA made large upfront/advance payments (hundreds of millions of dollars each) to HBM memory makers SK Hynix and Micron to secure future memory supply. These reports cite industry sources and supplier agreements. ([apps.digitimes.com](https://apps.digitimes.com/news/a20231227PD212/nvidia-sk-hynix-micron-hbm-supply.html?utm_source=openai))

- News reports (July 2025) say NVIDIA placed large, follow‑on orders with TSMC (for example, a reported order for 300,000 H20 chips) as demand and market conditions changed. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-orders-300000-h20-chips-tsmc-due-robust-china-demand-sources-say-2025-07-29/?utm_source=openai))

- Public statements by NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang in mid‑2024 indicate he has expressed support for TSMC charging higher prices for advanced manufacturing and packaging, saying the price increases reflect the value delivered. ([businessinsider.in](https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/nvidia-is-making-a-ton-of-money-now-main-supplier-tsmc-may-charge-jensen-huang-more-for-chips-/articleshow/110869201.cms?utm_source=openai))

- Trade and tech outlets have quoted NVIDIA communications and filings saying the company may "pay premiums and provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity" and that such actions have increased product costs in the past. ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-collects-huge-prepayments?utm_source=openai))

- Industry coverage documents cases where NVIDIA worked closely with suppliers (TSMC, SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung) on capacity and timing, including supplier investments and timetable changes to meet NVIDIA demand. These accounts come from Reuters, CNBC, and semiconductor trade press reporting on supplier cooperation and capacity commitments. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-huang-asked-sk-hynix-bring-forward-supply-hbm4-chips-by-6-months-sks-2024-11-04/?utm_source=openai))

## Point 7 - Question 2

**When regular customers face unexpected difficulties, does the company incur additional effort and expense to assist them, even if that lowers profit on the specific transaction, in order to deepen the relationship and enhance long-term returns?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA sells dedicated enterprise support. Customers can open support cases 24/7 through an Enterprise Support portal and contact NVIDIA by phone. Enterprise support includes technical help, warranty checks, and case tracking. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/support/enterprise/?utm_source=openai))

- For high-end systems (DGX), NVIDIA provides enterprise-grade support that can include remote hardware and software help, on-site engineers to replace field-replaceable parts, advanced return material authorizations (RMA/ARMAs), and options for a Technical Account Manager or site reliability engineers. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-support/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA offers advisory and professional services. These services send NVIDIA experts or partner experts to help customers plan, optimize, and deploy AI projects — for example, helping move models from prototype to production and giving tailored guidance for customers’ specific needs. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/support/enterprise/advisory-services/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA runs partner programs and ecosystems (the NVIDIA Partner Network) so customers can get help from trained system integrators, cloud partners, and service providers. These partners provide design, implementation, and ongoing services for NVIDIA-based solutions. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/partners/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA runs the Inception startup program that gives startups free training credits, cloud credits from partners, and preferred pricing on some NVIDIA hardware and software. The program is free to join and provides these resources to help early-stage customers grow. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s product and support offerings are presented as paid tiers or entitlements (some support is included with purchases; other support is sold separately or through partners). Enterprise support entitlements may be included with an initial purchase or purchased later from NVIDIA or authorized partners. ([docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/enterprise-support-and-services-user-guide/nvidia-enterprise-support-overview/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public filings say the company is investing in cloud, software, and services and that these new business models “may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue.” The same filings note the company has reduced average selling prices in the past because of channel pricing programs and other factors. (This shows NVIDIA recognizes it sometimes gives pricing or makes investments that affect near-term profit.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA publishes customer case examples and joint programs with large systems integrators and consultancies (for example, partnerships with Accenture and others) that aim to help end customers deploy NVIDIA technology at scale. These programs involve joint engineering, training, and deployment work by NVIDIA and partners.

- In May 2021 NVIDIA added "Lite Hash Rate" (LHR) to new GeForce RTX 30-series gaming cards to cut their efficiency at mining the Ethereum cryptocurrency. NVIDIA said the change was to make more cards available to gamers rather than crypto miners. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/lhr/?utm_source=openai))

- In February–March 2021 NVIDIA introduced a separate product line called "CMP" (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor). CMP cards were sold through partners and were aimed only at miners (no graphics), separating miner demand from the gaming product line. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/nvidia-cryptocurrency-mining-processor-for-ether-announced.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA reported total CMP product revenue for 2021 and the CMP business was a small share of total company revenue (example reported CMP revenue: about $550 million for fiscal 2021, a small fraction of overall revenue that year). ([bitcoinethereumnews.com](https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/crypto/nvidia-crypto-mining-processor-revenue-slumps-77-to-24m-in-q4-2021/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA created CUDA (its parallel computing software platform) and released the CUDA SDK publicly in 2007. CUDA and related libraries (toolkits that let programmers run work on NVIDIA GPUs) were distributed so developers could build on NVIDIA hardware rather than paying per-use fees. This helped build a large developer base that uses NVIDIA GPUs and software. ([docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.9.0/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA publishes and supports many free or broadly available developer libraries (for example cuDNN, TensorRT and other CUDA libraries) on its developer site; these software investments give developers tools for NVIDIA GPUs. ([docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/cudnn/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA runs the free "Inception" program for AI startups. The program gives startups training, developer tools, partner offers, cloud credits, and preferred pricing on some NVIDIA products; membership costs nothing. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA sells enterprise software (NVIDIA AI Enterprise) with multi-year subscription and perpetual-license options that include multi-year support. Some high-end GPUs are sold with several years of AI software subscription included (example: certain H100 models include a five‑year NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription). ([docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/planning-resource/licensing-guide/latest/licensing.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s research and development (R&D) spending is large and has grown quickly: the company reported R&D expenses of $8,675 million for fiscal year 2024 and $12,914 million for fiscal year 2025 (figures pulled from its filings). These R&D expenses reduce near-term profit but fund product and software development for future years. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA advertises long-term software maintenance options for enterprise customers (for example, “long-term branch maintenance” and support options up to multi-year branches for NVIDIA AI Enterprise), which provide ongoing fixes and updates over years rather than only short-term patches. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/faq/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has explicitly said (in its public communications) that measures such as LHR were taken to “get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers,” stating an aim to shift some short-term demand away from miners and toward its target consumer market. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/lhr/?utm_source=openai))

- Public reporting and company filings show CMP/mining-focused sales were not a large, lasting revenue stream for NVIDIA (CMP revenue rose and fell across quarters in 2021 and was described as a small portion of total revenue in filings). ([bitcoinethereumnews.com](https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/crypto/nvidia-crypto-mining-processor-revenue-slumps-77-to-24m-in-q4-2021/?utm_source=openai))

### Point 8 Criterion

Does the management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well AND when troubles occur?

## Point 8 - Question 1

**Do earnings-call transcripts of the company show forthright acknowledgment of problems and underperformance when they happen, or are difficult topics avoided or minimized?**

### Research Findings

Company: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker: NVDA).

Facts from earnings calls, in simple language (each item cites the source):

- May 28, 2025: NVIDIA said the U.S. told it a license was needed to export its H20 chip to China. The company took a $4.5 billion charge for unsellable H20 inventory and said it could not ship $2.5 billion of H20 sales that it had expected. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- On that same May 28, 2025 call, NVIDIA said the lost H20 sales would reduce near-term China revenue and that about $8 billion of planned H20 orders for the next quarter had to be scrapped. ([ae.marketscreener.com](https://ae.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/NVIDIA-CORPORATION-57355629/news/Transcript-NVIDIA-Corporation-Q1-2026-Earnings-Call-May-28-2025-50094557/?utm_source=openai))

- On the May 28, 2025 call Jensen Huang (CEO) said the China market was “effectively closed to U.S. industry” because of export controls, and he criticized the export rules as damaging U.S. market position. (reported in the earnings coverage and transcript). ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-ceo-hammers-chip-controls-that-effectively-closed-china-.html?utm_source=openai))

- In 2018–2019 (following the cryptocurrency mining boom and bust), NVIDIA’s calls and filings noted a sharp fall in crypto-related GPU demand and the company recorded a charge (reported as about $57 million) for prior-generation parts tied to that drop. The company described channel inventory as a near-term headwind but said it did not change long-term fundamentals. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-corporation-nvda-q3-2019-earnings-conference-call-transcript-2018-11-16?utm_source=openai))

- At multiple calls (example: Q4 2023) management said some cloud customers “paused … to recalibrate their build plans” and described part of a slowdown as a “timing issue,” meaning they attributed weaker near-term sales to customers shifting the timing of orders rather than to permanent loss of demand. ([fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript//?utm_source=openai))

- In several calls about supply and manufacturing (example: Q2 2024), NVIDIA said its supply partners were ramping capacity, described complex multi-part supply chains, and stated it expected supply to increase each quarter through the following year. These remarks explain shortages as production and ramping issues. ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nasdaq-nvda-q2-151348854.html?utm_source=openai))

- In the May 2025 reporting and related call, NVIDIA quantified how export rules affected guidance: management said reported guidance would have been about $8 billion higher if not for lost China sales, and provided adjusted vs. non-adjusted gross-margin and EPS figures showing the financial impact of the H20 charge. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Transcript examples (publicly posted by Seeking Alpha, Nasdaq, Motley Fool, Marketscreener and others) show executives answering analyst questions on topics such as channel inventory, product pull-ins/push-outs, supply chain timing, China demand, and export-control impacts; the transcripts record both specific dollar effects (charges, lost shipments) and management language that frames those problems as either discrete events or timing-related. ([seekingalpha.com](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4222728-nvidia-corp-nvda-ceo-jen-hsun-huang-on-q3-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- In more recent quarters (2024–2025), calls and press releases show NVIDIA distinguishing product lines and regions (for example, reporting data-center growth in the U.S. vs. weakness in China) and naming specific causes (customer pauses, export licensing changes, or supply constraints) when discussing revenue swings. These statements include numerical segment results (e.g., data-center revenue figures) alongside explanations. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- Media reports and analyst coverage of the calls (CNBC, Business Insider, Investopedia, The Guardian and others) summarize the same call details and quote management lines criticizing export policy or describing write-downs and lost shipments; these contemporaneous reports track how the company communicated the issues to investors and the public. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-ceo-hammers-chip-controls-that-effectively-closed-china-.html?utm_source=openai))

(End of factual items.)

## Point 8 - Question 2

**Are negative developments at the company disclosed through 8-K filings and press releases with sufficient context, or are such disclosures delayed, vague, or overly optimistic?**

### Research Findings

- What a Form 8‑K is and its timing rule:
  - Form 8‑K is a U.S. SEC form companies must use to tell the public about important events that happen between regular reports. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/compliance-disclosure-interpretations/exchange-act-form-8-k?utm_source=openai))
  - For most events, companies must file the Form 8‑K within four business days after the event. There are some exceptions (for example, certain Regulation FD items). ([hklaw.com](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2004/08/reminder-new-form-8k-requirements-with-accelerated?utm_source=openai))

- How Nvidia uses 8‑K filings and press releases:
  - Nvidia files many 8‑K reports on EDGAR. Its 8‑K filings often list press releases and related materials as exhibits (for example, company earnings press releases appear as Exhibit 99.1 and related CFO commentary as Exhibit 99.2). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000021/0001045810-25-000021-index.html?utm_source=openai))
  - Nvidia posts press releases on its investor relations site and those same press releases are often attached to the company’s 8‑K filings. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The wording Nvidia uses in press releases:
  - Nvidia press releases typically include “forward‑looking” language that says future results may differ because of risks, and they point readers to the company’s SEC reports for details about risks. This language appears in Nvidia press releases tied to product announcements. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Example: reports about a Blackwell GPU production issue (media reports and Nvidia statements)
  - Media reports in early August 2024 said Nvidia’s next‑generation “Blackwell” AI chips faced a design problem and possible shipment delays. These reports cited anonymous sources. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-stock-plummets-on-reported-delay-of-its-new-ai-chip-amid-global-sell-off-8690166?utm_source=openai))
  - Nvidia responded publicly with statements on its investor site and on earnings calls. Nvidia’s investor press material described a mask change to improve yields and said production ramp was scheduled for the fourth quarter, and company executives discussed fixes on an earnings call. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))
  - Reuters later reported (October 23, 2024) that Nvidia’s CEO said the Blackwell design flaw had been fixed and described the production status. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-design-flaw-with-blackwell-ai-chips-now-fixed-ceo-says-2024-10-23/?utm_source=openai))

- Regulatory and litigation history that relate to disclosure practices:
  - In May 2022 the SEC issued an order finding that Nvidia did not adequately disclose that cryptomining helped drive large increases in its “gaming” revenue in fiscal 2018; Nvidia agreed to a cease‑and‑desist order and to pay $5.5 million, without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-79?utm_source=openai))
  - A long‑running shareholder class action that alleges disclosure problems related to past crypto‑era revenue has continued in the courts; U.S. news reports in late 2024 and early 2025 describe appellate and Supreme Court filings and rulings in that matter. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-tosses-case-involving-securities-fraud-suit-against-nvidia-2024-12-11/?utm_source=openai))
  - In 2025 there were reports and shareholder inquiries about whether U.S. export controls were being circumvented for sales of Nvidia chips into China; at least one law firm announced an investor investigation in March 2025 citing news coverage. ([prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nvda-investors-have-opportunity-to-join-nvidia-corporation-fraud-investigation-with-the-schall-law-firm-302392298.html?utm_source=openai))

- Examples showing how Nvidia places press material in SEC filings:
  - Nvidia’s February 26, 2025 and May 28, 2025 8‑K filings on EDGAR include linked press releases and CFO commentary as exhibit files (EX‑99.1 and EX‑99.2). The EDGAR filing pages list those exhibits and the Item numbers (for example, Item 2.02: Results of Operations and Financial Condition). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000021/0001045810-25-000021-index.html?utm_source=openai))

- Statements on the public record about disclosure controls and risk topics:
  - Nvidia’s SEC filings (10‑K / 8‑K excerpts) describe a variety of risks that could force disclosure, including supply chain disruptions, security incidents, and regulatory matters; the filings state that certain incidents may require notification to customers, regulators, or investors. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

## Point 8 - Question 3

**In MD&A or investor presentations, does the company address business risks, operational challenges, or strategy setbacks with meaningful detail?**

### Research Findings

- The ticker NVDA is NVIDIA Corporation. (Form 10‑K for fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s MD&A is in Item 7 of its 2025 Form 10‑K (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). The filing compares fiscal 2025 to prior years and shows revenue, margins, and operating results tables. (Form 10‑K, Item 7, fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The MD&A and Risk Factors state that NVIDIA relies on third‑party foundries (for example TSMC and Samsung) to make its chips, and on contract manufacturers (for example Hon Hai/Foxconn, Wistron, Fabrinet) for assembly, testing and packaging. The company says its supply chain is mainly concentrated in the Asia‑Pacific region. (Form 10‑K, Business and Risk Factors / Item 1 and Item 7). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The MD&A and Risk Factors state competition and rapid technology change are material risks; NVIDIA lists key competitive factors such as performance, product breadth, software support, manufacturing capability, and pricing. (Form 10‑K, Risk Factors and Business discussion). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The MD&A identifies inventories as a critical accounting estimate. It explains how management makes judgments about excess or obsolete inventory and lists situations that can cause excess inventory: changes in demand, new product introductions, incorrect demand forecasts, ordering lead times, government regulations, and competitive actions. (Form 10‑K, Critical Accounting Estimates — Inventories). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- In the quarter ended Apr 27, 2025, NVIDIA reported total inventories of $11,333 million and disclosed large inventory provisions and excess inventory purchase obligation liabilities tied to certain products. The filing shows line‑item amounts for raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and excess inventory obligations. (Quarterly filing / balance sheet as of Apr 27, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))

- On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government informed NVIDIA that a license was required to export its H20 products to China. NVIDIA recorded a charge of $4.5 billion in Q1 fiscal 2026 tied to H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations because demand for H20 diminished after the licensing requirement. The company said it was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 in the quarter. (Company Q1 disclosure and press release, May 28, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The Apr 27, 2025 filing breaks the $4.5 billion charge into components: a $1.9 billion inventory provision for H20 product inventory and $2.6 billion recorded as excess inventory purchase obligation charges (part of the overall $4.5B). The filing shows how these amounts were recorded in cost of revenue and in liabilities. (Quarterly filing, Apr 27, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s subsequent filings and releases note additional movements related to H20 provisions: for example, a $180 million provision release in a later quarter when some H20 inventory was sold outside China, and overall provisions and releases that affected gross margin percentages for the periods disclosed. (Subsequent quarterly disclosure). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The MD&A and Risk Factors explicitly warn that failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led, and could lead, to mismatches between supply and demand, which can cause excess inventory or write‑downs. (Form 10‑K, Item 1A Risk Factors and MD&A inventory discussion). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s MD&A discloses customer concentration metrics for recent periods (for example, three direct customers accounted for 27%, 18% and 12% of accounts receivable as of Apr 27, 2025), showing dependence on a small number of large customers in some periods. (Quarterly filing, Apr 27, 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The MD&A includes a Liquidity and Capital Resources section with cash and marketable securities totals and the company’s view of liquidity: as of Jan 26, 2025, NVIDIA reported $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and stated it believed it had sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. (Form 10‑K, Liquidity and Capital Resources). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The Risk Factors and MD&A note legal and intellectual property risks, including that litigation or adverse IP rulings could cause significant costs, injunctive relief, or require licensing; the 10‑K refers readers to the Legal Proceedings note for specifics. (Form 10‑K, Item 1A Risk Factors; Item 3 Legal Proceedings; Notes to Financial Statements). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s investor news and event materials (earnings releases, conference presentations, GTC/CES/GTC keynotes and investor event pages) describe strategic initiatives (Blackwell platform, Spectrum‑X networking, Omniverse, DRIVE, partnerships, AI factory efforts) and also include standard forward‑looking cautionary language that those initiatives are subject to the same risks listed in SEC filings (competition, manufacturing reliance, market acceptance, etc.). (Investor news releases and event pages, 2024–2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Ultra-AI-Factory-Platform-Paves-Way-for-Age-of-AI-Reasoning/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The company’s public disclosures direct readers to its SEC filings (Form 10‑K and Form 10‑Q) for fuller detail on risks, contingencies, and the financial effects of events discussed in investor presentations and press releases; the 10‑K and quarterly filings contain the detailed numeric and narrative disclosures cited above. (Form 10‑K and quarterly filings; investor relations statements). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

## Point 8 - Question 4

**Is the tone of investor communication consistent across good and bad quarters, or does the company shift toward evasive language when performance weakens?**

### Research Findings

- Aug 8, 2022 — NVIDIA announced preliminary results for its second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company said preliminary revenue was about $6.70 billion, below its prior outlook of $8.10 billion, and that the shortfall was "primarily driven by weaker Gaming revenue." ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-resultsfor-second-quarter-fiscal-2023?utm_source=openai))

- Aug 24, 2022 — On the Q2 FY2023 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said: "Our expectations, our plans, were higher," and added that the company "did have to just take a rightsizing of that inventory." (earnings call transcript). ([fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/?utm_source=openai))

- Aug 23, 2023 — NVIDIA reported record revenue of $13.51 billion for second quarter fiscal 2024. In the company press release, CEO Jensen Huang said, in part, "A new computing era has begun." ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2024/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Aug 28, 2024 — For second quarter fiscal 2025 NVIDIA reported record revenue of $30.0 billion. The press release quoted CEO Jensen Huang saying, "Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible." ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Feb 26, 2025 — NVIDIA reported revenue of $39.3 billion for fourth quarter and fiscal 2025. The press release described record Data Center revenue and quoted CEO Jensen Huang saying, in part, "Demand for Blackwell is amazing." ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

- Across multiple quarterly press releases, NVIDIA gives numerical forward guidance in a standard form, e.g. "Revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%." (example: Q3 FY2025 outlook in the Q2 FY2025 release). This is presented as a single-point forecast with a small percentage range. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The company has used the word "preliminary" in at least one public release (Aug 8, 2022) when reporting a large shortfall and followed that with a full earnings release and an earnings call several weeks later. The preliminary release identified the main cause (weaker Gaming sell-in) and the follow-up call discussed inventory rightsizing and margin effects.

- In the Aug 8, 2022 preliminary release, CFO Colette Kress said the quarter included "significant charges" tied to earlier purchase commitments and described actions like slowing operating expense growth while continuing share buybacks. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-resultsfor-second-quarter-fiscal-2023?utm_source=openai))

- Press releases for quarters with strong results (examples above from Aug 23, 2023; Aug 28, 2024; Feb 26, 2025) consistently use words such as "record" (to describe revenue or Data Center revenue) and highlight product names (H100, Hopper, Blackwell) and large customer deployments. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2024/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The August 24, 2022 earnings call transcript includes executives answering analyst questions about inventory, gross margin and product mix, with executives naming specific causes (inventory rightsizing, mix shift away from high-end GPUs) rather than only using generic statements. ([fool.com](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA press releases and earnings materials routinely present segment-level numbers (for example, Gaming revenue, Data Center revenue) alongside company-wide totals, and they note year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter percentage changes for those segments. Examples: Q2 FY2024, Q2 FY2025, Q4 FY2025 releases. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2024/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- When a large variance occurred (Aug 2022), NVIDIA first issued a short "preliminary" release with the size of the miss and a brief cause, then held the formal earnings call and full release later in the month to provide more detail. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-resultsfor-second-quarter-fiscal-2023?utm_source=openai))

## Point 8 - Question 5

**During analyst calls or investor events, does management answer critical or difficult questions directly, or tend to deflect or avoid them?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA holds a live, company-hosted conference call after each quarterly earnings release. The call includes prepared remarks by executives followed by a live Q&A session that is limited to financial analysts and institutional investors. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Sets-Conference-Call-for-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA also holds investor-focused events (for example, GTC and a separate financial-analyst Q&A at GTC). Those events include public keynotes and a separate Q&A/webcast for analysts or investors. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-industry-visionaries-to-unveil-whats-next-in-ai-at-gtc-2025?utm_source=openai))

- Executives often speak directly and at length on technical and market topics during prepared remarks and the Q&A. Full earnings-call transcripts show Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress answering detailed questions about product ramps, architectures, and data-center demand. (Example: May 24, 2023 and May 29, 2024 earnings-call transcripts). ([seekingalpha.com](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4607199-nvidia-corp-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- Management has publicly given direct, specific comments about U.S. export controls and the effect on NVIDIA’s China business. For example, on an earnings call Jensen Huang said the China market was “effectively closed” and later called export controls a “failure.” These remarks were repeated in public interviews and news coverage in 2025. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/nvidia-ceo-hammers-chip-controls-that-effectively-closed-china-.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA disclosed large financial hits tied to China export rules and unsold H20 inventory. Public filings and company statements reported a multi-billion-dollar charge related to H20 chips (reports mention figures such as $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion in different company announcements and news reports). ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-says-it-will-record-5point5-billion-quarterly-charge-tied-to-h20-processors-exported-to-china.html?msockid=2aa612602f8969a733d504202e4c6814&utm_source=openai))

- At times executives have declined to give precise, public answers about the timing or scale of certain customer orders or specific commercial details. News coverage of March–July 2025 events recorded managers saying they would not give definitive order counts or exact timing for resuming shipments to China. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/as-nvidia-gets-a-lifeline-in-china-jensen-huang-goes-on-the-charm-offensive-in-beijing.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public filings (SEC 10‑K / 10‑Q) note ongoing regulatory and competition inquiries and state that the company receives broad requests for information from competition regulators; the filings list these requests and related risks. These filings make regulatory scrutiny and related disclosure limits a documented, formal risk. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Company press releases and investor pages show that NVIDIA provides written CFO commentary ahead of some earnings calls and posts webcasts and replays on its investor site. This creates multiple public channels (written, audio, video) where executives state facts and then answer analyst questions. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Sets-Conference-Call-for-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Independent news transcripts and earnings-call transcripts show examples of executives answering technical questions with detailed explanations (for example, explanations of product architectures, supply-chain complexity, and how specific GPUs fit customer use cases). These transcripts record verbatim answers from CEO and CFO across multiple quarters. ([seekingalpha.com](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4607199-nvidia-corp-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- Academic research on earnings calls (published analyses) documents that managers across large firms sometimes give “non-responses” or avoid direct answers, and that such non-responses can be identified and measured; this provides a general method researchers use to classify whether answers are direct or evasive. (See a 2025 working paper that develops a measure of manager non-responses in earnings calls.) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18419?utm_source=openai))

## Point 8 - Question 6

**When prior goals or commitments of the company are missed, does management openly revisit them and explain the causes, or do they go unmentioned?**

### Research Findings

- On August 8, 2022 NVIDIA issued a preliminary results statement saying its revenue would be about $6.70 billion versus a prior outlook of $8.10 billion, and that the shortfall was “primarily driven by weaker than forecasted Gaming revenue.” ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-resultsfor-second-quarter-fiscal-2023?utm_source=openai))

- On the August 24, 2022 earnings call NVIDIA’s finance chief said the revenue shortfall was caused by “macroeconomic headwinds” that reduced consumer demand for gaming products; management discussed the reasons on the call. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/nvidia-reports-slowing-growth-after-earlier-warning.html?utm_source=openai))

- On August 28, 2024 NVIDIA’s CEO publicly confirmed a delay in the ramp of its next‑generation “Blackwell” chips into the fourth quarter and described design/timing changes and ramp issues when answering analysts’ questions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-forecasts-third-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2024-08-28/))

- On May 28, 2025 NVIDIA’s official results and prepared commentary said the company was told on April 9, 2025 that a U.S. export license would be required for its H20 products to China; NVIDIA reported a $4.5 billion charge for excess H20 inventory and said it was unable to ship about $2.5 billion of H20 revenue as a result. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The May 28, 2025 earnings call transcript shows NVIDIA executives (CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress) discussed the H20 export‑license issue and its financial effects during prepared remarks and the analyst Q&A. ([seekingalpha.com](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790673-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- In NVIDIA’s February 26, 2025 quarterly results and investor commentary, management said it was accelerating production of the new Blackwell systems, explained that early ramp costs affected near‑term gross margins, and gave forward guidance while describing the ramp plan. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

- Academic research on earnings‑call behavior finds that managers sometimes give “non‑responses” to analyst questions, and that such non‑responses are linked to greater analyst forecast uncertainty; this is a general finding about some firms’ calls, not a statement about NVIDIA alone. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18419?utm_source=openai))

### Point 9 Criterion

Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which make the company outstanding relative to the competition?

## Point 9 - Question 1

**Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competition? In industries where leasing is material (e.g., retail), do the company’s lease terms and related occupancy costs compare favorably with peers, indicating superior site selection and negotiation skill? Does the company maintain lower credit losses or demonstrate more disciplined credit policies than competitors, suggesting more effective risk control? Where insurance is a significant expense, are total insurance costs (relative to sales or assets) materially lower than industry averages, reflecting stronger control of accidents, damage, and waste? If the company is a large firm, does a strong but not over-relied-upon patent portfolio broaden profit margins? For smaller firms with unique products, is the patent protection sufficiently broad to deter larger rivals? Does continuous product or process improvement, rather than static patent protection alone, provide the primary competitive edge? Based on the company’s business model, operating environment, or sector characteristics, are there any other distinctive aspects (e.g., logistics, supply chain strategy, regulatory positioning, customer switching costs) that may offer a significant competitive advantage or disadvantage? Provide all relevant information found ONLY; don’t answer the question directly and do not add any context in your final output other than the information presented.**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA designs chips but does not own large factories; it uses outside foundries and assembly partners to make and package its products. ([secinfo.com](https://www.secinfo.com/dvT9t.g5.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for advanced wafer making and on advanced packaging technologies such as TSMC’s CoWoS to build its high-end AI modules. ([prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nvidia-ceo-reiterates-solid-partnership-with-tsmc-302096782.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA uses very high‑bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced multi‑chip packaging for its top data‑center GPUs; those memory and packaging steps are special supply points that can limit output and raise cost. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA is a “fabless” company (it outsources wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging), which lowers capital spending but makes it dependent on outside suppliers for capacity and yields. ([secinfo.com](https://www.secinfo.com/dvT9t.g5.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has bought companies to add networking and storage technology; the 2020 acquisition of Mellanox brought high‑speed interconnects (InfiniBand and Ethernet) into NVIDIA’s product mix.

([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Market research and news reports indicate NVIDIA holds a very large share of the high‑end AI GPU market and add‑in‑board GPU shipments in recent quarters (various analyst and industry group estimates put NVIDIA’s share in the high‑percent range for key segments). ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s “full‑stack” approach (chips, networking from Mellanox, and software) is used by hyperscalers and large AI customers, who often buy whole systems rather than single chips. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion?utm_source=openai))

- U.S. export controls and other government rules have restricted shipments of some high‑performance NVIDIA data‑center products to China and other markets; the company reported related inventory charges tied to restricted products. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html?utm_source=openai))

- Government and competition authorities in multiple jurisdictions have opened probes or sought information about NVIDIA’s market practices; U.S. authorities (Justice Department) and Chinese regulators (SAMR) have investigated or opened inquiries in recent years. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/nvidia-hit-with-subpoena-us-justice-department-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-09-03/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s supply chain has seen tightness at advanced packaging and memory steps; industry reports and company statements note that packaging capacity and memory availability have been limiting factors for shipment volumes. ([trendforce.com](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/01/31/news-nvidia-expands-advanced-packaging-supply-chain-with-intels-inclusion-diverting-orders-from-tsmc?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s sales strategy includes long‑term purchase commitments and supply agreements; the company reports significant purchase obligations and prepaid supply arrangements in its SEC filings and annual reports. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has expanded offerings beyond raw chips into networking, software, full systems, and industry platforms (for example automotive DRIVE and cloud/enterprise AI platforms), broadening where it competes and earns revenue.

### Point 10 Criterion

In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company NOT require sufficient equity financing so that the larger number of shares then outstanding will largely cancel the existing stockholders’ benefit from this anticipated growth?

## Point 10 - Question 1

**What level of external capital will be needed over the next several years based on management’s disclosed capital-expenditure plans, acquisitions, and growth initiatives? Given current cash, projected operating cash flow, and prudent borrowing capacity (using industry-standard leverage norms), could these needs be met without issuing new equity?**

### Research Findings

- Cash and short-term investments (company report): NVIDIA reported cash and cash equivalents of $11,639 million and marketable securities of $45,152 million, for total cash + marketable securities of $56,791 million as of July 27, 2025. This is the company’s liquid money and easily-sold investments. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm))

- Shorter-term cash figure (company report): NVIDIA reported cash and cash equivalents of $8,589 million and marketable securities of $34,621 million, for total cash + marketable securities of $43,210 million as of January 26, 2025.

([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Capital spending (company actuals): NVIDIA reported purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets of $3,236 million for fiscal 2025 (year ended Jan 26, 2025). For the six months ended July 27, 2025, purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets were $3,122 million. These are the company’s reported capital expenditures (money spent to buy buildings, equipment, and similar items). ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Investing and financing cash flows (recent): NVIDIA’s net cash used in investing activities was $(20,421) million for fiscal 2025 and $(12,343) million for the six months ended July 27, 2025. Net cash used in financing activities was $(42,359) million for fiscal 2025 and $(27,386) million for the six months ended July 27, 2025. These show how much cash left the company for investments and for financing (buybacks, debt repayments, dividends).

([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Commercial paper program (company report): NVIDIA has a $575 million commercial paper program and reported no commercial paper outstanding as of July 27, 2025 and as of January 26, 2025. This is a short-term borrowing facility the company can use if needed. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Net cash position (simple subtraction of company numbers): 
  - As of July 27, 2025: cash + marketable securities $56,791M minus debt $8,466M = net cash ≈ $48,325M. 
  - As of January 26, 2025: cash + marketable securities $43,210M minus debt $8,463M = net cash ≈ $34,747M. 
  These are company cash and debt numbers minus one another; a positive result means the company held more cash and marketable investments than interest-bearing debt. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm))

- Share repurchases and authorizations (company report and filings): NVIDIA repurchased $33,706 million of common stock in fiscal 2025. During the first half of fiscal 2026 the company repurchased $24,200 million; in the second quarter alone it repurchased $9,700 million (67 million shares), as reported in the company filings for the half-year ended July 27, 2025. NVIDIA’s Board approved an additional $60.0 billion share-repurchase authorization on August 26, 2025. These are large cash uses the company has disclosed for returning capital to shareholders. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Unrecognized tax and other contingent liabilities (company report): NVIDIA reported unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 billion (including interest and penalties) recorded in non-current income tax payable as of July 27, 2025. This is a potential future cash requirement if tax positions are settled unfavorably. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Debt coupon costs (company report): NVIDIA reported interest expense of $247 million for fiscal 2025. This is the company’s reported cash interest cost for the year on its debt. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Earnings and EBITDA components (company report and simple sum): For fiscal 2025 NVIDIA reported net income of $72,880 million, income tax expense of $11,146 million, depreciation and amortization of $1,864 million, and interest expense of $247 million. Adding those items gives an approximate EBITDA of $86,137 million for fiscal 2025 (EBITDA = net income + interest + taxes + depreciation & amortization). EBITDA is a rough measure of operating earnings before some non-cash and financing items. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Company-stated near-term outlook items (management guidance): For the third quarter of fiscal 2026 (outlook given Aug 27, 2025) NVIDIA expected revenue of $54.0 billion ±2%. The company expected GAAP operating expenses of about $5.9 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses of about $4.2 billion for that quarter, and said full-year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth would be in the high-30% range. These are management’s reported near-term revenue and expense outlook numbers. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2026?utm_source=openai))

- Company capital-return statement in filings: NVIDIA’s filings state the company believes it had sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, describing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and operating cash flow as primary liquidity sources (company statements in 10-Q and 10-K). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm))

- Industry / credit-metric context for leverage (third-party sources): 
  - S&P Global reported the median debt-to-EBITDA ratio for investment-grade companies was about 2.69 (a broad market median used by credit analysts). This gives a reference point for leverage commonly seen in rated, investment-grade firms. ([spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/12/total-debt-for-rated-us-companies-reaches-new-high-86683893?utm_source=openai))
  - Financial-education sources state common rule-of-thumb ranges: net-debt-to-EBITDA below 1 is generally considered very low leverage, while net-debt-to-EBITDA above about 3 is often viewed as higher leverage and may raise credit concerns; acceptable ranges vary by industry and ratings agency. These are commonly cited benchmarks used by analysts and lenders. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-debt-to-ebitda-ratio.asp?utm_source=openai))

- Examples of loan covenant / leverage thresholds observed in practice (external example): Some company loan agreements and covenants set maximum net-debt-to-EBITDA or debt-to-EBITDA thresholds in the range of about 3.5x (example from a public company loan covenant disclosure). This shows one type of limit that lenders sometimes impose; actual covenant levels differ by borrower and deal. ([mundurek.com](https://mundurek.com/article/net-debt-ebitda-ratio?utm_source=openai))

- Material long-term supply or capacity obligations and timing (company report): NVIDIA reported purchase obligations by year (as of July 27, 2025) with large near-term amounts (for example, about $30,930 million shown for fiscal 2026 excluding the first half of fiscal 2026 in the company’s commitments table). These scheduled purchase obligations represent cash the company has contractually agreed to pay over coming years. ([br.advfn.com](https://br.advfn.com/noticias/EDGAR2/2025/artigo/96714207?utm_source=openai))

- Recent announced product and infrastructure programs (company releases): NVIDIA has announced large product and infrastructure programs (examples: Blackwell data-center product shipments, Spectrum-X networking, Omniverse deployments, and the Boston Accelerated Quantum Research Center). These initiatives are described in company press releases and imply continued investment in product development, partnerships, and customer deployments. The press releases give program descriptions and intended scope (technical and deployment scale), but not always full dollar budgets.

## Point 10 - Question 2

**Does management indicate—by statement or past practice—that it will exhaust reasonable debt capacity before turning to equity, and has it historically followed this approach?**

### Research Findings

- NVDA is the ticker for NVIDIA Corporation, a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000118/forms-arsmay2025.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Management says the company has an active capital‑return program and that it is a key part of capital allocation. (Example: CFO Colette Kress: “Our capital return program continues to be a key element of our capital allocation strategy.”) ([ng.investing.com](https://ng.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-nvidia-beats-q1-2025-expectations-stock-up-43-1942255?utm_source=openai))

- The Board has repeatedly authorized very large share‑repurchase programs. On August 26, 2024 the Board approved an additional $50.0 billion in repurchase authority (no expiration). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000316/nvda-20241027.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The Board approved another large repurchase increase on August 26, 2025: an additional $60.0 billion, without expiration. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Recent repurchase activity (selected amounts reported by the company): fiscal year 2025 repurchases — 310 million shares for $34.0 billion; fiscal year 2024 repurchases — $9.7 billion; fiscal year 2023 repurchases — $10.04 billion. The company has described continuing plans to repurchase shares as it weighs market factors and other investment opportunities. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The company started paying a regular cash dividend in 2024 and increased the quarterly amount in May 2024; cash dividends paid in fiscal 2025 totaled $834 million. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000124/nvda-20240428.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s filings state that the repurchase program is intended to offset dilution from shares issued to employees, and that repurchases may be suspended at management’s discretion. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA reports and discloses its access to external capital and says it “continuously evaluate[s] our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital.” (Liquidity and capital resources section of its Form 10‑K / 10‑Q.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company has an active shelf registration that allows it to offer debt securities, common stock, preferred stock and other securities from time to time (automatic shelf registration statement filed May 28, 2025). ([d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001045810/163ce92a-81bb-4200-84b0-1edceefdd719.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has used the public debt market multiple times. It has issued unsecured senior notes across several years (examples include long‑dated notes such as 3.50% notes due 2050 and 3.70% notes due 2060) and the company’s filings list the outstanding note amounts and maturities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations and the filings describe the company’s compliance with covenants for those notes. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000175/nvda-20230730.htm?utm_source=openai))

- In earlier debt offerings (example: 2016 notes), NVIDIA stated it intended to use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included share repurchases and prefunding repayment of convertible notes. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-pricing-of-2-0-billion-notes-offering?utm_source=openai))

- At the end of the fiscal year reported in the 2025 filing (January 26, 2025), NVIDIA reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $43,210 million and reported net long‑term carrying amount of debt of $8,463 million (debt maturities schedule and related notes are disclosed in the filings). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company operates a $575 million commercial paper program for general corporate purposes but reported no commercial paper outstanding as of the January 26, 2025 filing date. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000227/nvda-20231029.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Shares outstanding have been broadly stable or reduced over recent years (quarterly share counts reported in public data show shares outstanding after the 2024 forward split remained roughly in the mid‑20 billion share range and have changed modestly quarter to quarter). ([macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/shares-outstanding?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA issues shares for employee compensation and issues small amounts of stock in acquisition‑related transactions; the filings show net share settlements for RSUs and specific small issuances tied to an acquisition. ([filings.assets.koyfin.com](https://filings.assets.koyfin.com/filings/52416c2a744598786274125b6494c6d7/1045810/000104581024000124/nvda-20240428.htm?utm_source=openai))

## Point 10 - Question 3

**Are there shelf registration statements, announced equity offerings, or other signals that material share issuance is planned within the foreseeable period? If so, what is the expected magnitude relative to the existing share count?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA filed a new shelf registration statement (Form S-3) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 28, 2025. The prospectus for that shelf is dated May 28, 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000118/forms-arsmay2025.htm))

- The May 28, 2025 prospectus says NVIDIA may sell, from time to time and in one or more offerings, any combination of securities including common stock (the company’s ordinary shares), preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, and stock purchase contracts or units. Each actual sale would be described in a separate prospectus supplement. (Plain meaning: the shelf lets the company issue shares or other securities later, but each specific sale needs its own supplement with details.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000118/forms-arsmay2025.htm))

- The May 28, 2025 shelf registration replaces NVIDIA’s prior registration statement from 2023. The new filing says the earlier (2023) registration will be terminated when the May 28, 2025 registration becomes effective. (Plain meaning: the company updated and renewed its shelf in 2025.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000118/forms-arsmay2025.htm))

- NVIDIA reported the number of shares of common stock outstanding as 24.4 billion as of February 21, 2025 (this same 24.4 billion figure is also reported as of May 23, 2025 in the company’s Form 10-Q). (Plain meaning: about 24.4 billion shares existed at those dates.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s Form 10-K for fiscal 2025 discloses that during fiscal year 2025 the company withheld about 59 million shares to cover taxes on restricted stock unit (RSU) vesting (net-share settlements). (Plain meaning: the company transferred about 59 million shares to itself to pay employee tax withholdings on stock awards in that fiscal year.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The same Form 10-K discloses two small issuances in late 2024 related to acquired-company employees: 94,560 shares issued on December 6, 2024 and 205,110 shares issued on December 29, 2024 (both described as issuances in connection with acquisitions and not public offerings). (Plain meaning: the company issued a few hundred thousand shares to employees of acquired companies, not as a public offering.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The May 28, 2025 prospectus states that any sale of securities under the shelf will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement that will describe the specific terms, amounts and timing of any particular offering. (Plain meaning: the shelf itself does not state how many shares will be sold; each sale needs a separate document with the exact numbers and timing.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000118/forms-arsmay2025.htm))

- I searched NVIDIA’s SEC filings and the company’s press releases through October 7, 2025 for a prospectus supplement or an SEC Form 8‑K by NVIDIA announcing a specific registered offering of common stock under the May 28, 2025 shelf; I did not find a filed prospectus supplement or an 8‑K by NVIDIA that announces a public offering of common stock under that May 28, 2025 shelf. (Plain meaning: the shelf is in place, but I found no SEC filing from NVIDIA that gives the exact terms and size of a public share sale under that shelf as of Oct 7, 2025.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000118/forms-arsmay2025.htm))

## Point 10 - Question 4

**After accounting for all outstanding options, warrants, convertibles, and any reasonably expected new equity, what is the estimated fully diluted share count, and how would this affect prospective per-share earnings and the economic benefit to current shareholders?**

### Research Findings

- Company identity and filings used: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker NVDA). Facts below come from NVIDIA’s public SEC filings: Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended April 27, 2025 and July 27, 2025, and NVIDIA’s 2025 proxy materials. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Basic shares outstanding (common stock) on NVIDIA’s 2025 meeting record date: 24,387,557,065 shares outstanding as of April 28, 2025. (This is the count of shares that existed and could vote on that date.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Shares outstanding reported in 10-Q filings near mid-2025:
  - As of May 23, 2025: about 24.4 billion shares outstanding. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm?utm_source=openai))
  - As of August 22, 2025: about 24.3 billion shares outstanding. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Weighted-average shares used in per-share (EPS) calculations (company’s GAAP figures):
  - Fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025 — Basic weighted average shares: 24,555 million (i.e., 24.555 billion). Diluted weighted average shares: 24,804 million (24.804 billion). The reported dilutive impact from outstanding equity awards for that year was 249 million shares. (These are the company’s calculated “diluted” share counts that were used to compute GAAP diluted EPS for FY2025.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))
  - Quarter / six months ended Jul 27, 2025 — Basic and diluted weighted averages for the periods are reported (example: six months diluted weighted average = 24,571 million, with a dilutive impact of 167 million). (These show the more recent per-share denominators used by NVIDIA for interim EPS.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm))

- Equity awards and “shares issuable” (stock awards that can become shares):
  - Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights (aggregate reported as of Jan 26, 2025): 274,212,251 shares. This line in the equity plan table represents shares underlying outstanding RSUs/PSUs/rights (options were not outstanding). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs outstanding (detailed movement): balance was 274 million shares as of Jan 26, 2025; during the period NVIDIA granted ~48 million, vested ~78 million, canceled/forfeited ~5 million, leaving a balance of ~239 million shares outstanding as of Jul 27, 2025. (This shows the recent count of unvested/unpaid stock awards that could convert into shares.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm))
  - The company reported unearned stock‑based compensation tied to these awards of about $14.0 billion (aggregate future expense), expected to vest over a weighted average period (~2.2 years for RSUs/PSUs). (This indicates multi-year vesting that would convert to shares over time if awards vest.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm))

- Stock options and similar instruments:
  - NVIDIA’s filings state the company “has not had any stock options outstanding since the end of Fiscal 2024.” (That means there were no outstanding stock options to exercise into shares as of the report date; outstanding share-convertible instruments are primarily RSUs/PSUs/other rights.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and shares available under plans:
  - As of Jan 26, 2025, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (aggregate of the 2007 Plan and ESPP) was 3,628,661,705 shares (about 3.629 billion). The company also reported that under the ESPP, up to ~3.38 million shares might be purchased in the then-current purchase period (this is limited by participant contribution and the IRS $25,000 limit). (This shows the pool of shares legally available to be issued in future awards or purchases.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Recent real issuances under equity plans (examples of how many new shares are actually issued):
  - In fiscal 2025 the company granted an aggregate of 82,467,905 shares under the 2007 Plan (counting PSUs at maximum). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - During fiscal 2025, employees purchased ~30,121,348 shares under the ESPP. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))
  - During fiscal 2025, NVIDIA withheld approximately 59 million shares to cover tax obligations when RSUs vested (net‑settlement withholding). (Net settlement reduces how many new shares remain outstanding after an award vests.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Warrants, convertible debt, and other convertible securities:
  - NVIDIA’s debt disclosures list unsecured senior notes and other standard debt; the company’s equity-plan table shows the number of securities issuable on exercise of outstanding options/warrants/rights as 274,212,251 (see above). NVIDIA’s filings do not disclose any separate outstanding convertible notes or public warrants that would convert into common stock. (No convertible securities or public warrants are shown in the debt or equity plan notes in the 10-K / 10-Q disclosures.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Share repurchases and program authorizations (these reduce shares outstanding and offset dilution when executed):
  - On August 26, 2024, NVIDIA’s Board approved an additional $50 billion to its repurchase authorization (no expiration). In fiscal 2025 the company repurchased ~310 million shares for $34.0 billion. As of Jan 26, 2025, the company had remaining repurchase authorization (subject to specifications) of about $38.7 billion; as of Jul 27, 2025 the company reported remaining approximate dollar capacity of $14.7 billion under its program after repurchases in fiscal 2026 first half. NVIDIA repurchased 67 million shares in Q2 FY2026 (and 193 million shares in the first half of FY2026). (Share repurchases lower the number of shares outstanding when executed.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Company authorization to issue common stock (charter limits):
  - NVIDIA’s amended certificate of incorporation (post stock split) shows the company is authorized to issue up to 80,002,000,000 shares in total, of which 80,000,000,000 are common stock. (This is the legal ceiling on shares the company could issue without further charter amendments.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- How the company reports and treats dilution for EPS calculations (method used in filings):
  - NVIDIA computes diluted EPS using the treasury stock method and reports the dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards (for example, 249 million for fiscal 2025 and 167 million for the six months ended July 27, 2025). Anti‑dilutive awards (those that would reduce EPS if included) are excluded. (This explains which instruments the company already counts in its published “diluted” share totals.)

### Point 11 Criterion

Does the company have a worthwhile operating profit margin?

## Point 11 - Question 1

**To consistently calculate and compare operating profit margins without inconsistency, YOU MUST USE the following standardized approach. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR RESEARCH IS THAT Begin by defining Operating Profit Margin as GAAP Operating Income divided by GAAP Operating Revenues, expressed as a percentage. These figures should come directly from a company’s audited financial statements—specifically the Consolidated Statement of Income in its Form 10-K or 10-Q. First, locate the Operating Income line item. It may appear as “Operating Income” or “Income from Operations.” Do not use “adjusted” or “non-GAAP” versions such as “operating earnings,” “core EBIT,” or “segment EBIT,” even if they are highlighted in earnings presentations or third-party sites. These adjusted metrics often exclude depreciation, hedge marks, impairments, or restructuring charges, and are not suitable for consistent peer comparison. Next, identify the Operating Revenues (sometimes labeled “Net Sales”) for the same fiscal period. Ensure that both operating income and revenue figures are taken from the same report and are stated in matching units (e.g., both in millions or thousands of dollars). Then compute the margin by dividing operating income by operating revenues and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Use this GAAP-based formula without adjustments. Even if the company experienced unusual events like asset sales, fuel hedging losses, or storm recovery costs, these should remain in the calculation. They may be discussed qualitatively as sources of volatility, but they must not be excluded from the margin formula. To compare margins across years or companies, repeat the exact same method using only fiscal-year GAAP data. Do not substitute trailing-twelve-month numbers or selectively adjusted periods. By applying this consistent definition—GAAP operating income divided by GAAP operating revenues without exclusions—you ensure that your operating margin comparisons are clean, comparable, and grounded in audited, standardized financial reporting. The point of the above approach is to provide the relevant information need to answer these questions, but do not actually answer them or include any context about your answer in your final output other than the information. What has been the company’s operating profit margin (operating income ÷ net sales) for each of the past five fiscal years, and what is the multi-year average? How does that margin rank versus direct industry peers over the same period (top tier, middle, or bottom)? During the most recent industry up-cycle and down-cycle, did the company’s margin fluctuate less sharply than lower-margin competitors (indicating structural strength) or more sharply (indicative of a marginal cost position)? If the current margin is narrow, do regulatory filings or management comments show that this is the result of deliberately elevated spending on R&D, sales promotion, or other growth investments rather than an entrenched cost disadvantage? Is there clear evidence—such as sustained cost leadership, pricing power, or proprietary products—that could enable the company to maintain or widen its margin over the long run?**

### Research Findings

Definition (use this GAAP formula only)
- Operating profit margin = (GAAP Operating Income ÷ GAAP Operating Revenues (Net sales)) × 100. Take both numbers from the Consolidated Statement(s) of Income in the company’s audited Form 10‑K (or the matching fiscal-period 10‑Q). Use the line labeled “Operating Income” or “Income from Operations.” Do not use adjusted/non‑GAAP operating measures. (Source: NVIDIA Form 10‑K filings — see citations below).

### Point 12 Criterion

Does the company have depth to its management—that is, a broad base of capable leaders, effective delegation, and a culture that develops and retains executive talent beyond one or two key individuals?

## Point 12 - Question 1

**Is there clear evidence of a formal succession plan for top management and a well-developed leadership bench that mitigates key-person risk?**

### Research Findings

- Jensen Huang is the company’s co‑founder, president and chief executive officer. He has led NVIDIA since he started the company in 1993. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/board-of-directors/jensen-huang//?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s 2025 preliminary proxy was filed with the SEC for the June 25, 2025 annual meeting and describes the company’s board, its committees, and senior management in detail. The proxy identifies a Lead Independent Director role and says the CEO has “primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company.” ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- The proxy describes the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC). The NCGC’s listed duties include identifying and recommending director candidates, recommending committee assignments, assessing board performance, and reviewing corporate governance matters. The proxy notes the NCGC met three times in fiscal 2025 and that its agenda included “Board recruiting” among other topics. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- The 2025 proxy statement does not contain a section titled “Succession” or “Succession Planning” and does not present a named CEO successor in the proxy materials. (Source: NVIDIA’s 2025 proxy statement filed with the SEC.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Outside reporting and a 2025 biography of Jensen Huang state that the company has not publicly named a successor. The author Stephen Witt reports that when asked NVIDIA said it had no succession plan and quotes Huang as saying “I don’t have a successor.” ([penguinrandomhouse.com](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/757558/the-thinking-machine-by-stephen-witt/?utm_source=openai))

- Senior, long‑tenured executives and technical leaders at NVIDIA include (examples): Colette Kress — Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Debora Shoquist — Executive Vice President, Operations; Tim Teter — Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and technical leaders such as Ian Buck (vice president responsible for CUDA and hyperscale/HPC work). These named executives appear on NVIDIA’s management pages and in company and press materials. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/governance/management-team/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The proxy emphasizes active board oversight of risk management, regular executive sessions of independent directors, annual board and committee self‑assessments, and annual stockholder outreach — governance practices the company presents as supporting oversight of senior management. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm))

- Independent reporting has highlighted both NVIDIA’s deep technical bench (examples above) and concerns about centralization of decision‑making around Jensen Huang. Reviews of NVIDIA’s leadership note Huang’s direct oversight of many senior reports and raise questions about whether a formal, named succession plan has been made public. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/ian-buck-nvidia-moat-cuda-2025-6?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s investor and corporate web pages list current executive officers and board members by name and role; those pages provide the company’s official roster of senior leaders as of 2025. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/governance/management-team/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

## Point 12 - Question 4

**Are authority and decision-making responsibilities effectively delegated across divisions or functions, rather than centralized in the CEO or a small inner circle?**

### Research Findings

- The ticker NVDA is NVIDIA Corporation. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

## Point 12 - Question 5

**Do disclosures or commentary from management indicate an executive climate that rewards merit, minimizes factionalism, and encourages collaboration and upward-flowing ideas?**

### Research Findings

- Jensen Huang asks many employees to send a short weekly note called a “Top 5 Things” (T5T). He says he reads these notes to see what people at the edges of the company are working on. ([stripe.com](https://stripe.com/au/sessions/2024/a-conversation-with-nvidias-jensen-huang?utm_source=openai))

- Company and news reports say Huang discourages private one‑on‑one meetings with direct reports; he says he prefers to share information and give feedback to groups so everyone can learn together. ([stripe.com](https://stripe.com/au/sessions/2024/a-conversation-with-nvidias-jensen-huang?utm_source=openai))

- Reports say Huang spends time eating and talking with employees in company spaces, and that he has a large number of direct reports (about 60), which he uses to reduce layers between him and other staff. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/jensen-huang-nvidia-routine-management-leadership-style-ceo-founder-2024-4?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public policies page posts a formal Code of Conduct and tells people how to report concerns confidentially through a “Speak Up” line (a third‑party confidential reporting channel). ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/about-nvidia/company-policies/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s U.S. SEC filings (Form 10‑K / proxy) say the Board’s Compensation Committee helps oversee human‑capital matters (hiring, development, retention, diversity and culture). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm?utm_source=openai))

- SEC filings list employee counts at year‑end (for example, about 36,000 employees worldwide as of the end of fiscal 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s proxy and filings state the company offers equity to most employees (RSUs, PSUs and market‑based PSUs). RSUs usually vest over four years; PSUs vest over periods that depend on service and meeting pre‑set performance or market targets. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The company’s proxy filings describe a “pay‑for‑performance” approach for executives: a large share of executive pay is tied to performance metrics and long‑term equity that vests only if goals or market targets are met. The filings say a very high percentage of the CEO’s target pay is performance‑dependent. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s proxy materials state the company’s compensation program is designed to “reward performance” and to align employee interests with shareholders by giving equity that vests over time. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s filings report low overall turnover in recent years (the proxy says overall turnover was about 2.5% in fiscal 2025). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s filings say many new hires come from employee referrals (the company reported over 40% of new hires in Fiscal 2024 were employee referrals). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

- In public interviews and conference talks, Jensen Huang describes practices he says promote transparency and information flow (brevity in email, frequent company‑wide communication, reading many employees’ T5T notes, and explaining his reasoning publicly so others can learn). ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sends-hundreds-emails-staff-daily-2023-11?utm_source=openai))

2) What management said (company explanations in filings and earnings releases)
- FY2021 (management statements about FY2021 results)
  - Management said the company had record revenue for Gaming and Data Center in FY2021, and highlighted that the Mellanox acquisition expanded NVIDIA’s footprint in the data center. (CEO and press release summary). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2021/?utm_source=openai))

- FY2022 (management explanations for changes in margins)
  - Management said gross margin rose in FY2022 mainly because there were lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges compared with FY2021 (FY2021 included a one-time inventory step-up charge), and because of a higher-end mix within Graphics (Gaming). Management also said a mix shift in Compute & Networking (Data Center) partially offset those benefits. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581022000036/nvda-20220130.htm))  
  - Management said operating expenses increased in FY2022 mainly from stock-based compensation, higher headcount/compensation, and higher infrastructure costs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581022000036/nvda-20220130.htm))

- FY2023 (management explanations for changes in margins)
  - Management said gross margin fell in FY2023 versus FY2022. The company reported higher cost of revenue and changes in product mix; management also disclosed a significant one-time acquisition termination cost charged in FY2023 that raised operating expenses. Management highlighted that Data Center and Gaming trends and inventory provisions affected margins. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2023/))  
  - Management discussed that R&D and other operating expenses rose in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in FY2023, which reduced operating margin. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2023/))

- FY2024 (management explanations for changes in margins)
  - Management said gross margin and operating margin widened sharply in FY2024 because Data Center revenue grew a lot (management cited very large Data Center demand and product launches such as Hopper/H100), improving the company’s product mix toward higher‑margin sales. Management also noted lower relative inventory provisions versus the prior year. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2024/))

- FY2025 (management explanations for changes in margins)
  - Management said gross margin increased in FY2025 “driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.” The FY2025 Form 10‑K also shows cost of revenue as a smaller share of revenue (25.0% in FY2025 vs 27.3% in FY2024) and shows research & development and SG&A rose in dollars but fell as a percentage of revenue (R&D 9.9% of revenue in FY2025 vs 14.2% in FY2024), which management described as operating leverage from much larger revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
  - In the FY2025 earnings release, management (CEO) said demand for the new Blackwell family of AI products was “amazing” and cited ramping massive-scale production as a key driver of revenue and margins. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

3) Additional company facts related to margins (from filings)
- Inventory provisions and related reserve releases affected gross margin in multiple years; NVIDIA disclosed inventory provisions and releases and the net percentage effects in its MD&A for FY2024 and FY2025. (Examples: net unfavorable impact on gross margin of ~2–3% in FY2024 and FY2025 from inventory provisions and related items as disclosed by the company.)

## Point 13 - Question 2

**What specific cost-reduction or efficiency programs (automation, supply-chain optimization, capital-improvement projects, product-engineering initiatives) has management disclosed to offset rising labor, material, or tax expenses?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA says its Blackwell GPU architecture and related systems cut operating cost and energy for AI inference and training by large multiples versus the prior generation (NVIDIA’s announcement states “up to 25x” less cost and energy in some workloads). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- CEO Jensen Huang told reporters that making faster chips is NVIDIA’s primary way to lower the cost of running AI; he said faster chips reduce the cost per unit of AI work (for example, cost per token). ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/nvidias-huang-says-faster-chips-are-the-best-way-to-reduce-ai-costs-.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA announced new networking and photonics products (Spectrum‑X / Quantum‑X) that the company says reduce data‑center energy use and operating cost (the press release cites ~3.5× energy savings for certain configurations). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Spectrum-X-Photonics-Co-Packaged-Optics-Networking-Switches-to-Scale-AI-Factories-to-Millions-of-GPUs/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA describes Omniverse and “physical AI” tools as ways to let manufacturers build digital twins and simulations that speed factory setup, cut manual work, and improve operational efficiency. NVIDIA and partners say these tools let factory customers automate workflows and reduce hours in real operations. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Expands-Omniverse-With-Generative-Physical-AI/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA says partners such as Foxconn are using NVIDIA Omniverse and industrial AI to speed factory bring‑up and improve efficiency; public comments and transcripts cite Foxconn expecting large reductions in manual hours (one cited example: a Foxconn facility reporting a ~30% reduction in annual hours after using digital‑twin/automation tools). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/Foxconn-Builds-AI-Factory-in-Partnership-With-Taiwan-and-NVIDIA/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has made large purchase and capacity commitments to secure supply for new products. Its 2025 Form 10‑K discloses $30.8 billion of outstanding inventory purchase and long‑term supply and capacity obligations, and it says some of those commitments raise product costs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The 10‑K also says NVIDIA has paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered long‑term supply agreements and capacity commitments to secure future supply and capacity, and that those actions have increased its product costs. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s 2025 annual filing shows capital spending rose (the company spent $3.4 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 versus $1.1 billion in fiscal 2024) and states it expects to increase capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 to support growth. These capital projects fund things like infrastructure, compute, and supply‑chain capacity. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA has disclosed multi‑party projects and partnerships to build “AI factories” and regional infrastructure (examples: announced partnerships to build AI factory projects with Foxconn and with Saudi partners). These projects are positioned as large capital and supply‑chain efforts to scale production, improve resilience, and enable automation. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/Foxconn-Builds-AI-Factory-in-Partnership-With-Taiwan-and-NVIDIA/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Public reporting (press and analyst coverage of company remarks) says NVIDIA’s management is planning large investments in U.S. supply‑chain capacity and sourcing to create more resilience. Management framed this as a supply‑chain optimization step even though building local capacity can raise near‑term costs. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-invest-billions-us-chip-production-over-four-years-ft-reports-2025-03-20/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has disclosed tax‑related items in filings: its 2025 annual report shows $2.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as non‑current income tax payable (the filing notes timing and uncertainty of these tax liabilities). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA has warned in its 10‑K that higher costs for wafers, components, logistics, employees, facilities, and new regulations (including carbon or energy taxes) have reduced, and could continue to reduce, its margins; the filing links these cost pressures to supply commitments, capital spending, and regulatory changes. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA and industry sources report NVIDIA holds very large shares of advanced packaging capacity (reports cite NVIDIA securing a majority share of some TSMC CoWoS packaging capacity for 2025), which management uses to support product ramps and supply continuity. Securing that capacity is part of NVIDIA’s supply‑chain approach. ([site.financialmodelingprep.com](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/market-news/nvidia-nasdaqnvda-secures-over--of-tsmcs-advanced-chip-packaging-capacity-for-?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public materials repeatedly present product engineering (faster, more power‑efficient chips and system designs) and software (inference microservices, Omniverse simulation tools) as levers to lower customers’ operating costs and to improve system efficiency; management points to those engineering gains as a way to reduce total cost of ownership for AI workloads. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

## Point 13 - Question 3

**To what extent has management preserved margins through price increases, and how sustainable is this strategy given current and expected competitive capacity?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s reported full‑year fiscal 2025 gross margin was 75.0% (GAAP) compared with 72.7% in fiscal 2024 — a rise of 2.3 percentage points. (NVIDIA press release, Feb 26, 2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx))

- In the quarter ended Aug 26, 2025 (Q2 fiscal 2026), NVIDIA reported gross margin of 72.4% (GAAP) and guided to mid‑70% range for full‑year margins as its Blackwell product family ramps. (NVIDIA Q2 FY26 press release, Aug 26, 2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s data‑center business (the part that sells GPUs and related systems) was about $115.2 billion of $130.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025 — roughly 88% of total revenue — showing that high‑value data‑center products drive most sales. (NVIDIA fiscal 2025 results, Feb 26, 2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx))

- Company management has said the new Blackwell family (B/GB/GB200 series) is a premium product mix and that the Blackwell ramp is a main reason for current margin levels; they have also said margins are temporarily in the low‑70s during the ramp and should improve to the mid‑70s as yields and production scale. (NVIDIA earnings transcripts and CFO commentary, 2025). ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- Public and analyst estimates put the average selling prices (ASPs) for recent NVIDIA data‑center GPUs in the tens of thousands of dollars per unit: H100/A100 family estimates commonly reported in 2024–2025 center around $25,000–$40,000 per high‑end GPU; early Blackwell/GB200 estimates by analysts put some Blackwell configurations in similar or higher ranges. These are analyst and press estimates, not official list prices. (CNBC, Reuters, analyst reports May 2024–2025). ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has been selling more complete systems and rack solutions (not only individual chips), and management has pointed to higher margins from selling full systems and custom configurations. (NVIDIA investor materials and earnings comments, 2024–2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx))

- Cloud providers and other buyers have negotiated large contracts and deployments that affect demand and pricing. On Sept 22, 2025 NVIDIA and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for a partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems, with NVIDIA saying it may invest up to $100 billion as systems are deployed. (NVIDIA and OpenAI press releases, Sept 22, 2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/OpenAI-and-NVIDIA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-to-Deploy-10-Gigawatts-of-NVIDIA-Systems/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- On Oct 6, 2025 AMD and OpenAI announced a separate multi‑year agreement for AMD to supply up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs (starting with a 1‑gigawatt deployment in second half of 2026). This is a material new source of large‑scale GPU capacity from a competitor. (AMD and OpenAI press release, Oct 6, 2025). ([amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-6-amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-d.html?utm_source=openai))

- Major cloud providers have introduced substantial price cuts for GPU instances in 2025; for example, AWS announced reductions of up to about 44% for some H100 instances and up to 33% for some A100 instances effective June 2025. Public cloud list‑price moves affect how much customers pay per hour to use GPUs. (AWS blog; coverage June 2025). ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-up-to-45-price-reduction-for-amazon-ec2-nvidia-gpu-accelerated-instances/?utm_source=openai))

- Independent market studies and analysts reported that NVIDIA held an extremely large share of data‑center GPU shipments in recent years (TechInsights reported NVIDIA shipped ~3.76 million datacenter GPUs in 2023 and estimated a very high market share, ~98% by unit shipments in 2023). That dominance means competitors had small installed bases but were expanding in 2024–2025. (TechInsights reported coverage, June 2024). ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))

- Competitors with growing supply or alternative chips in 2024–2025 include: AMD (Instinct MI300/MI350 and planned MI450), Intel (Habana Gaudi2/Greco family and other accelerators), and hyperscaler custom chips (Google TPUs, AWS Trainium/Inferentia). Each supplier has announced product roadmaps and some cloud deployments during 2024–2025. (AMD, Intel, Google product announcements and press coverage). ([amd.com](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-6-amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-d.html?utm_source=openai))

- Foundry and advanced‑packaging capacity are an important physical constraint for high‑end GPUs. Industry reports through 2024–2025 said TSMC and its advanced packaging (CoWoS/CoWoS‑L) capacity was being expanded and that NVIDIA had booked a very large share of advanced packaging capacity for its Blackwell chips; reporters and industry trackers described NVIDIA as taking a majority share of advanced packaging capacity in 2024–2025. (TrendForce, industry reporting 2024–2025; Reuters reporting on packaging demand). ([trendforce.com](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/05/06/news-tsmcs-advanced-packaging-capacity-fully-booked-by-nvidia-and-amd-through-next-year/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has reported inventory and export‑control impacts to sales in China (e.g., charges and lost shipments related to H20 restrictions) and has said it is introducing lower‑spec chips for China; such geopolitical constraints affected which products could be sold and where in 2024–2025. (Reuters May 24, 2025; NVIDIA earnings commentary). ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-launch-cheaper-blackwell-ai-chip-china-after-us-export-curbs-sources-say-2025-05-24/?utm_source=openai))

- Public cloud per‑hour prices, analyst ASP estimates, and company revenue/margin disclosures are the primary public evidence for how much price or product‑mix changes have contributed to NVIDIA’s overall margins; NVIDIA’s public filings and earnings calls for fiscal 2024–2026 provide the company’s stated revenue mix, gross margins, and management comments about ramp, yields, and margin outlooks. (NVIDIA investor releases and earnings call transcripts, 2024–2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx))

- Reported supply‑and‑demand actions in 2025 included hyperscalers increasing deployments of NVIDIA Blackwell systems (NVIDIA and cloud partners announced multi‑rack and pod deployments) while other large buyers started to contract with AMD and use non‑NVIDIA accelerators — these moves change future competitive capacity and buying options. (NVIDIA, AMD, OpenAI, and cloud provider announcements Sept–Oct 2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/OpenAI-and-NVIDIA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-to-Deploy-10-Gigawatts-of-NVIDIA-Systems/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Analyst and media price estimates for specific chips vary across sources; official, per‑unit list prices are not always published by sellers for the highest‑end datacenter GPUs, so press and analyst figures (e.g., $25k–$70k ranges reported for H100/Blackwell variants by various outlets and analysts) are estimates based on system pricing, reseller listings, and analyst models. (CNBC, Tom’s Hardware, HSBC analyst notes, 2024–2025). ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s own published guidance and CFO commentary (multiple 2024–2025 quarters) tie margin trends to product mix (data center systems, Blackwell ramp) and to manufacturing yields and packaging costs; NVIDIA has said margins dipped during early Blackwell deliveries and were expected to recover toward the mid‑70% range as production scales and costs improve. (NVIDIA earnings releases and transcripts, 2024–2025). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx))

- Public articles and market reports in 2024–2025 show the industry actively expanding capacity (foundries, packaging, hyperscaler builds) and some large new supplier deals (AMD with OpenAI, NVIDIA with OpenAI) that change the expected supply of high‑performance accelerators over 2026 and beyond. Dates and providers for these announcements: NVIDIA–OpenAI (Sept 22, 2025); AMD–OpenAI (Oct 6, 2025); AWS price cuts announced June 2025.

## Point 13 - Question 4

**Where margins are presently narrow, is this due to consciously elevated investment in R&D, sales promotion, or other growth-oriented spending, and has management articulated when margins should expand as these investments mature?**

### Research Findings

- Company and documents cited: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker NVDA). Facts below come from the company’s filings, quarterly reports, earnings transcripts, and investor press releases. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Fiscal year totals (year ended Jan 26, 2025): revenue $130.497 billion; gross margin 75.0%; operating expenses $16.405 billion (operating expenses were up 45% from the prior year). (These are the audited annual numbers the company filed with the SEC.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Research & development (R&D) spending (fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025): R&D expense was $12.914 billion, equal to 9.9% of revenue. The prior fiscal year (ended Jan 28, 2024) R&D was $8.675 billion and was 14.2% of revenue. (Shows R&D dollars rose and the R&D share of revenue fell because revenue grew a lot.) ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/5EBFB425AD1D43945A255B6E3A1E3927B06A7141?utm_source=openai))

- Sales, general & administrative (SG&A) spending (fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025): SG&A expense was $3.491 billion versus $2.654 billion the prior year (a 32% increase in dollars). ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/5EBFB425AD1D43945A255B6E3A1E3927B06A7141?utm_source=openai))

- Operating-expense guidance and management language: management said they are “accelerating investments in the business to address the magnitude of growth opportunities,” and guided higher operating expenses (stating operating expenses are expected to grow in the high‑thirties percent year-over-year versus prior expectations). The company gave projected GAAP and non‑GAAP operating expense amounts for the year in public guidance. ([ph.investing.com](https://ph.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-nvidia-q2-2025-strong-earnings-beat-drives-stock-uptick-93CH-1974978?utm_source=openai))

- Capital expenditures: the company spent $3.4 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 versus $1.1 billion in fiscal 2024, and said it expects to increase capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 to support future growth. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Inventory and related charges affecting margins: the 2025 10‑K reports provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations of $3.7 billion in fiscal 2025 (and $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024). The company said these items had an unfavorable effect on gross margin (noting a net unfavorable impact of about 2.3 percentage points on gross margin in fiscal 2025). ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/5EBFB425AD1D43945A255B6E3A1E3927B06A7141?utm_source=openai))

- Q1 Fiscal 2026 special charge and short‑term margin effect: on April 9, 2025 the U.S. government told NVIDIA that an export license was required for H20 products to China. NVIDIA recorded a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 FY2026 related to excess H20 inventory and purchase obligations. That quarter’s GAAP gross margin fell to 60.5%; excluding the H20 charge the company reported a gross margin of about 71.3% for the quarter. (The company disclosed this in its Q1 FY2026 press release.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Management comments about product ramp and margins: company executives (including CFO Colette Kress) said that during the ramp of the company’s next‑generation Blackwell products gross margins would be lower (described as “low‑70s” in comments) while manufacturing and system ramp costs are being incurred. They said once Blackwell production fully ramps, gross margins should improve to the mid‑70% range later in the fiscal year. CEO Jensen Huang and other executives also described accelerating manufacturing to meet demand and said investments in infrastructure give a strong return. These statements were made in recent earnings calls and public remarks. ([webull.com](https://www.webull.com/news/12380837088819200?utm_source=openai))

- Recent quarter operating‑expense percentages (quarter ended Jul 27, 2025): R&D was 9.2% of revenue and SG&A was 2.4% of revenue for the three months ended Jul 27, 2025 (company consolidated results in the filed quarterly report). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Company statement on margin targets: in public guidance and on earnings calls the company has stated a target or expectation to “exit the year” with non‑GAAP gross margins in the mid‑70% range, after current product ramps and one‑time inventory impacts are resolved. ([ph.investing.com](https://ph.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-nvidia-q2-2025-strong-earnings-beat-drives-stock-uptick-93CH-1974978?utm_source=openai))

- Where margin pressure has come from (as reported by the company): the filings and releases list higher manufacturing costs during product ramps, inventory provisions and excess purchase obligations, charges tied to H20 export/license developments, and higher absolute operating expenses as drivers that have weighed on margins in the near term. ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/5EBFB425AD1D43945A255B6E3A1E3927B06A7141?utm_source=openai))

## Point 13 - Question 5

**Does the company set explicit margin or cost-savings targets and regularly report progress, indicating an institutionalized commitment to margin management?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s quarterly earnings press releases always show its reported GAAP and non‑GAAP gross margin and operating‑expense numbers, and they publish a numerical outlook (guidance) for next quarter gross margin and operating expenses.

- In the earnings outlook for the quarter reported May 28, 2025, NVIDIA said it was “continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid‑70% range late this year.” (This is an explicit, public statement about a margin level the company is trying to reach.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- In later quarterly outlooks NVIDIA restated a similar aim, saying it “continues to expect to exit the year with non‑GAAP gross margins in the mid‑70% range.” (That repeats the same target across quarters.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s quarterly releases and SEC filings show it reports both GAAP and non‑GAAP margins and often publish reconciliations that exclude specific one‑time charges (for example, “gross margin excluding H20 charge”). Those reconciliations appear in the company’s press releases and outlook tables. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s Form 10‑K (fiscal year ended January 26, 2025) reports its fiscal‑year gross margin (75.0% for FY2025) and explains drivers of margin changes (for example, product mix and inventory provisions) in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis. ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/5EBFB425AD1D43945A255B6E3A1E3927B06A7141?utm_source=openai))

- Example reported numbers showing the company tracks margin progress quarter‑to‑quarter: Q4 FY2025 GAAP gross margin was reported as 73.0%, and full‑year FY2025 GAAP gross margin was 75.0% (both published in NVIDIA’s official results). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s quarterly outlooks also give explicit guidance for operating expenses (both GAAP and non‑GAAP) for the coming quarter and comment on expected full‑year operating‑expense growth ranges, showing the company publicly sets and reports expense plans as well as margin plans.

Is the company’s financial management and skill good?

## Point 14 - Question 1

**How effectively does management allocate capital—measured by return on invested capital (ROIC), disciplined capital-expenditure decisions, and avoidance of low-return projects?**

### Research Findings

- Revenue (what the company sold) for fiscal 2025: $130,497 million. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Operating income (profit from running the business, before interest and taxes) for fiscal 2025: $81,453 million. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Income before income tax and income tax expense for fiscal 2025: income before tax $84,026 million; income tax expense $11,146 million (effective tax rate 13.3%). (You can use these to convert operating profit into after-tax operating profit.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Research & development expense for fiscal 2025: $12,914 million. (R&D is money spent to make new products and improve existing ones.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Capital expenditures (money spent on buildings, equipment, servers, factory tools) by fiscal year:
  - Fiscal 2025: $3.4 billion.
  - Fiscal 2024: $1.1 billion.
  - The company stated it expects capital expenditures to increase in fiscal 2026 versus fiscal 2025 to support growth. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Cash and short‑term marketable securities (money the company can quickly use) as of January 26, 2025: $43,210 million. (This is cash the company could use instead of raising new money.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Balance sheet size and capital-structure items as of January 26, 2025:

  - Total shareholders’ equity: $79,327 million.
  - Long-term debt (net carrying amount): $8,463 million. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Two simple ways to measure “invested capital” from the 10‑K numbers (different ROIC calculations use different definitions):
  - Total assets minus cash and marketable securities = $111,601m − $43,210m = $68,391 million. (This treats cash as non‑operating and measures the asset base used in the business.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))
  - Total debt plus shareholders’ equity minus cash and marketable securities = ($8,463m + $79,327m) − $43,210m = $44,580 million. (This measures capital supplied by creditors and owners, less excess cash.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- A simple ROIC calculation building blocks (formula and where to find the numbers above):
  - After‑tax operating profit (NOPAT) ≈ operating income × (1 − effective tax rate). (Use operating income and the tax expense/effective tax rate above.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))
  - Invested capital can be measured as either (a) total assets − cash & marketable securities, or (b) total debt + shareholders’ equity − cash & marketable securities, using the balance‑sheet numbers above. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Other capital commitments and obligations that affect capital use (as of January 26, 2025):
  - Inventory purchase and long-term supply/capacity obligations totaling $30.8 billion (commitments to buy components, capacity, and other goods/services). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Notes about investment discipline and project selection stated in filings (exact company wording, fiscal 2025 10‑K):
  - The company said its share repurchase program “aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements” and that repurchases “may be suspended at any time at our discretion.” ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

## Point 14 - Question 3

**Have independent auditors, regulators, or the company itself identified material weaknesses, restatements, or other accounting issues that call financial controls into question?**

### Research Findings

- April 2002 / September 11, 2003 — The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) found that NVIDIA had reported a quarter (April 30, 2000) with sales that were too high because the company recorded a $3.3 million supplier credit but did not record the company’s obligation to repay that credit later. The SEC said NVIDIA’s books and internal accounting controls were not adequate for that period and issued a cease-and-desist order. The SEC reported that the quarter’s gross profit was overstated by 6.4%, net income by 15.3%, and earnings per share by 14.8%. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/administrative-proceedings/34-48480?utm_source=openai))

- September 11, 2003 — The SEC filed a separate enforcement action against NVIDIA’s former chief financial officer, Christine B. Hoberg, saying she failed to record the $3.3 million repayment obligation to the supplier. Hoberg consented to pay penalties and disgorgement (about $671,695) and was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-18343?utm_source=openai))

- 2006 (internal review completed November 13, 2006) — NVIDIA’s audit committee investigated company stock-option grant practices. The committee found some grants used incorrect measurement dates for accounting. NVIDIA amended (restated) prior financial statements for certain years and took non-cash charges (reported around $127 million) to correct stock-based compensation accounting. The company said the restatements were required because of those control deficiencies. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000119312506243226/d10qa.htm?utm_source=openai))

- As of January 29, 2006 (disclosed in the company’s filings) — NVIDIA’s management concluded that the control problems that led to the option-related restatements did not constitute a “material weakness” as of that date, because management said effective controls were in place at that time to prevent or detect a material misstatement. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000119312506243224/d10ka.htm?utm_source=openai))

- May 6, 2022 — The SEC charged NVIDIA for failing to disclose that growth in its “gaming” revenue in certain 2017 quarters was driven significantly by customers using GPUs for cryptomining. The SEC found NVIDIA had inadequate disclosure controls and procedures for that matter. NVIDIA agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million civil penalty. The SEC said the company had violated disclosure rules and failed to maintain adequate disclosure controls. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-79?utm_source=openai))

- February 21, 2024 and February 26, 2025 (Annual reports / Form 10-K) — NVIDIA’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), issued audit reports that expressed unqualified opinions on NVIDIA’s consolidated financial statements and stated that, as of January 28, 2024 and January 26, 2025 respectively, NVIDIA maintained effective internal control over financial reporting “in all material respects.” (The Form 10‑K filings include PwC’s audit reports and PwC’s consent to those reports.) ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/BC239FE0177447E4FEEA5C8C389B6E280A4BAD98?utm_source=openai))

- March–April 2025 (company disclosure) — NVIDIA disclosed that U.S. export license requirements put limits on certain products and said the company expected its first fiscal quarter of 2026 to include charges (inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves) that could be up to approximately $5.5 billion. The company filed this information in an SEC Form 8‑K in April 2025. (This is a company disclosure about large charges and reserves; it does not itself state a control failure or restatement.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000082/nvda-20250409.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Summary of company and regulator actions in plain language:
  - Regulators (the SEC) have in the past found that NVIDIA’s past financial reports were incorrect and ordered remedies (2002/2003). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/administrative-proceedings/34-48480?utm_source=openai))
  - NVIDIA’s own audit committee and management have investigated and restated prior results for stock-option accounting problems (2006) and disclosed the corrections. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000119312506243226/d10qa.htm?utm_source=openai))
  - The SEC separately fined NVIDIA in 2022 for not disclosing that cryptomining had driven parts of its gaming revenue and said NVIDIA’s disclosure controls were inadequate for that issue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-79?utm_source=openai))
  - In recent annual audits (2024 and 2025), the company’s auditor (PwC) issued clean (unqualified) audit opinions and said NVIDIA’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of the reported audit dates. ([publicnow.com](https://www.publicnow.com/view/BC239FE0177447E4FEEA5C8C389B6E280A4BAD98?utm_source=openai))

### Point 15 Criterion

How effective are the company’s research and development efforts in relation to its size?

## Point 15 - Question 1

**How has R&D spending (absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales) trended over the past five years, and how does this compare with close industry peers after adjusting for differences in what each firm classifies as R&D?**

### Research Findings

NVIDIA (ticker NVDA) — fiscal-year R&D totals and R&D as a percent of sales
- Fiscal year ended Jan 26, 2025: R&D expense $12,914 million; R&D = 9.9% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Jan 28, 2024: R&D expense $8,675 million; R&D = 14.2% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Jan 29, 2023: R&D expense $7,339 million; R&D = 27.2% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Jan 30, 2022: R&D expense $5,268 million; R&D = 19.6% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Jan 31, 2021: R&D expense $2,071 million; (company revenue for that year shown in filings). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm))

Notes from NVIDIA’s filings about what is included or reported separately
- NVIDIA reports stock‑based compensation inside operating expenses (including amounts allocated to R&D), and it shows amounts of research-related costs that the company has capitalized for tax/financial reporting purposes (the company discloses a growing balance described as “capitalized research and development expenditure” on its deferred tax note). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))  
- NVIDIA’s reported “capitalized research and development expenditure” (a balance reported in the tax/deferred‑tax note) rose to $6,256 million as of Jan 26, 2025 and was $3,376 million as of Jan 28, 2024. These balances indicate amounts of R&D-related costs that the company has on its books as capitalized (tax/balance‑sheet) amounts. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- NVIDIA’s filings call attention to the U.S. tax rules (TCJA) that require certain R&D expenditures to be capitalized for tax purposes beginning in the relevant fiscal period; the company discloses the tax impact in its filings. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm))

Peer: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — fiscal R&D totals and percent of sales (selected years)
- Fiscal year ended Dec 28, 2024: R&D expense $6,456 million; net revenue $25,785 million → R&D ≈ 25.0% of revenue. ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002488-25-000012/amd-20241228.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Dec 30, 2023: R&D expense $5,872 million; net revenue $22,680 million → R&D ≈ 25.9% of revenue. ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002488-25-000012/amd-20241228.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Dec 31, 2022: R&D expense $5,005 million; net revenue $23,601 million → R&D ≈ 21.2% of revenue. ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002488-25-000012/amd-20241228.htm))  
- Fiscal year 2021 (calendar/fiscal): R&D expense (annual) $2,845 million (public historical dataset). ([pro.macrotrends.net](https://pro.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/research-development-expenses?utm_source=openai))  
- Fiscal year 2020 (annual): R&D expense (annual) $1,983 million (public historical dataset). ([pro.macrotrends.net](https://pro.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/research-development-expenses?utm_source=openai))

Notes from AMD’s filings about classification
- AMD shows stock‑based compensation included in R&D (the filing discloses the portion of stock‑based comp allocated to R&D). AMD’s public filings do not present large balances like NVIDIA’s “capitalized research and development expenditure” in the same way; AMD discusses the tax treatment change under U.S. rules that affects how some R&D is treated for tax purposes, but AMD’s consolidated statements show R&D as operating expense amounts. ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000002488-25-000012/amd-20241228.htm))

Peer: Intel Corporation — fiscal R&D totals and percent of sales (selected years)
- Fiscal year ended Dec 28, 2024: R&D expense $16,546 million; net revenue $53,101 million → R&D ≈ 31.2% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086325000009/intc-20241228.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Dec 30, 2023: R&D expense $16,046 million; net revenue $54,228 million → R&D ≈ 29.6% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086325000009/intc-20241228.htm))  
- Fiscal year ended Dec 31, 2022: R&D expense $17,528 million; net revenue $63,054 million → R&D ≈ 27.8% of revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086325000009/intc-20241228.htm))  
- Fiscal year 2021 (annual): R&D expense (annual) $15,190 million (public historical dataset). ([macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/research-development-expenses?utm_source=openai))  
- Fiscal year 2020 (annual): R&D expense (annual) $13,556 million (public historical dataset). ([macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/research-development-expenses?utm_source=openai))

Notes from Intel’s filings about classification and comparability
- Intel’s filings show very large R&D spending driven in part by investments in process technology and manufacturing R&D. Intel’s consolidated statements also include acquisition‑related intangible items (including in‑process R&D recorded on acquisitions) and show interest capitalized on certain long‑lived assets; Intel’s R&D line in the consolidated statements is the operating expense labeled “Research and development.” These elements (process/foundry investments, acquisition IPR&D, capitalized interest, and where costs are recorded) mean Intel’s R&D number reflects a different business model mix (including foundry and heavy process‑technology investment) compared with fabless peers. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086325000009/intc-20241228.htm))

Other facts that affect apples‑to‑apples comparisons
- Some companies (including NVIDIA) disclose amounts of R&D costs that are capitalized (shown in deferred tax notes and balance‑sheet related notes). Capitalized development costs can be recorded on the balance sheet and then amortized; those capitalized amounts are not fully visible in the single “R&D expense” line unless the company discloses additions and amortization. NVIDIA’s deferred‑tax note shows a large and rising balance labeled “Capitalized research and development expenditure.” ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Tax rules (U.S. TCJA changes referenced in company filings) required certain R&D costs to be capitalized for tax purposes starting in the relevant years; companies’ filings note the tax impact separately from GAAP R&D expense. This affects the tax presentation and deferred tax items even when GAAP R&D expense is reported in the income statement. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm))  
- Companies differ in whether and how they (a) capitalize internal‑use software or engineering development costs, (b) record in‑process R&D from acquisitions as intangible assets, and (c) allocate stock‑based compensation into R&D. These differences appear in the notes to each company’s consolidated financial statements and affect whether a simple “R&D expense” line is directly comparable across firms. Example disclosures: NVIDIA and AMD show stock‑based compensation amounts allocated to R&D; NVIDIA and AMD disclose capitalized R&D/tax balances in notes; Intel discloses large process‑technology investments and acquisition‑related IPR&D in its notes. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

## Point 15 - Question 2

**What evidence shows that the company converts its R&D outlays into commercially successful products, processes, or cost savings large enough to justify the spending relative to company scale?**

### Research Findings

- R&D spending (company report): NVIDIA spent $12,914 million on research and development in fiscal year 2025 (the year ended Jan 26, 2025). This was 9.9% of the company’s revenue that year. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- R&D spending (prior year): NVIDIA spent $8,675 million on research and development in fiscal year 2024 (the year ended Jan 28, 2024). This was 14.2% of revenue that year. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- Size of R&D organization: As of the end of fiscal year 2025, NVIDIA had about 36,000 employees worldwide; about 27,100 of those employees worked in research and development. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Company scale and total revenue: NVIDIA’s total revenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130,497 million (about $130.5 billion). ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Data Center revenue (big product outcome): NVIDIA reported Data Center revenue of $115,186 million (about $115.2 billion) for fiscal year 2025. The company showed this growth was driven largely by its GPU and networking products for data centers. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Segment-level revenue showing R&D conversion: NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking segment (the part that includes its data-center chips and networking products) reported $116,193 million in revenue for fiscal 2025, up sharply from $47,405 million the prior year. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Reported cause of data-center growth: NVIDIA’s 10‑K says Data Center computing revenue grew 162% year over year in fiscal 2025 and attributes that growth primarily to demand for its Hopper and Blackwell GPU platforms. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Quarterly evidence of product-driven sales (examples): In NVIDIA’s public quarterly releases, Data Center revenue was reported as $26.3 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and $30.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, showing large, product-linked quarterly sales. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- High profit margins on products: NVIDIA reported gross margins of about 75.0% for fiscal 2025, indicating the company sells products and systems at high markups versus their direct costs. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Operating profit scale: NVIDIA reported operating income of $81,453 million for fiscal 2025, reflecting large profits after operating expenses (including R&D). ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Market share evidence for product adoption (discrete GPUs): Industry research firms reported NVIDIA holding an extremely large share of the discrete GPU market in 2025 (reports around 92–94% of add-in-board GPU shipments in various quarters), showing wide adoption of its graphics and AI cards. ([jonpeddie.com](https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q225-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-increased-27-0-from-last-quarter/?utm_source=openai))

- Developer ecosystem and software adoption: NVIDIA’s own product announcements state a developer community of millions (press materials cite a community of over 6 million developers and thousands of CUDA-enabled applications), showing broad software and developer support for its GPU platform. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Unveils-Rubin-CPX-A-New-Class-of-GPU-Designed-for-Massive-Context-Inference/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Cloud and enterprise customers using NVIDIA products: Major cloud providers and enterprise partners publicly announce NVIDIA-based offerings and instances (for example, AWS EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA A100/H100 and long‑running collaborations with Microsoft Azure to adopt NVIDIA’s Blackwell and H100-based offerings). These public product listings and announcements show large cloud customers buy and sell services built on NVIDIA hardware. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/?utm_source=openai))

- Product and system launches linked to revenue: NVIDIA’s public launch events and product pages for major GPU families (H100, Hopper, Blackwell, and subsequent Blackwell-class systems) are repeatedly cited in the company’s earnings materials and 10‑K as drivers of the large increases in Data Center revenue. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2025?utm_source=openai))

- Investments to support product rollouts: NVIDIA disclosed large purchase and capacity commitments (for example, multi-year cloud service agreements and inventory purchase obligations) and capitalized R&D amounts that increased in fiscal 2025—showing the company invested in production, cloud partnerships, and engineering as it introduced new platforms. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358))

- Example customers named in product rollouts: NVIDIA press releases and investor communications name enterprise customers and partners (for instance, early adoption lists for some server GPU products and public collaborations with companies such as Microsoft, AWS partners, and other large technology customers) that adopted NVIDIA’s new data-center products. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

## Point 15 - Question 3

**How effectively does management coordinate multidisciplinary research teams with production and sales groups to ensure new offerings can be manufactured efficiently and meet market needs?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA’s reported research-and-development spending for fiscal year 2024 was $8,675 million (about 14.2% of revenue). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- The company says it has invested about $45.3 billion in research and development since it started. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- At the end of fiscal 2024 NVIDIA reported about 29,600 employees worldwide. Of those, about 22,200 worked in research and development, and about 7,400 worked in sales, marketing, operations, or administrative roles. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- NVIDIA’s public filings say the company relies on outside firms to make, assemble, test and package its chips, and that this reliance reduces NVIDIA’s direct control over quantity, quality, yields (how many good chips are made), and delivery timing. The filings list a small number of key suppliers and geographic concentration of suppliers as risks. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- NVIDIA works closely with large semiconductor manufacturers (foundries). NVIDIA has joint projects and production relationships with TSMC (the main foundry for NVIDIA’s AI GPUs). News reports and company announcements say some NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs have been or are being produced at TSMC’s Arizona plant while advanced packaging steps have remained tied to Taiwan facilities. (A “foundry” makes the raw chips; “packaging” is the later step that puts the chip into a finished module.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/TSMC-and-Synopsys-Bring-Breakthrough-NVIDIA-Computational-Lithography-Platform-to-Production/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA announced a production partnership for a software-to-manufacturing tool called cuLitho that moved from research into production with TSMC and Synopsys on March 18, 2024. cuLitho uses NVIDIA’s GPUs and software to make one step of chip manufacturing much faster, and the companies said it reduced compute time dramatically when integrated into TSMC’s workflow. This is an example where NVIDIA research was integrated with a foundry’s production systems. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/TSMC-and-Synopsys-Bring-Breakthrough-NVIDIA-Computational-Lithography-Platform-to-Production/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA runs reference designs and partner programs so other companies can build systems that use NVIDIA chips. For example, NVIDIA has a longtime HGX/HGX-architecture partner program with large server makers (ODM/ODMs such as Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron, Inventec) so those manufacturers can build and ship servers that use NVIDIA designs. These partnerships connect NVIDIA engineers and product designs to the companies that actually build and sell server hardware. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-partners-with-world-s-top-server-manufacturers-to-advance-ai-cloud-computing?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA offers cloud and production services tied to its technology. It launched an “AI foundry” service (with Microsoft Azure) that bundles NVIDIA models, tools, and DGX Cloud computing so customers can develop and deploy AI work. NVIDIA also reports multi‑year cloud-service agreements that it uses to support development and testing. These services link NVIDIA’s research tools and software to cloud providers and customers who deploy products. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Introduces-Generative-AI-Foundry-Service-on-Microsoft-Azure-for-Enterprises-and-Startups-Worldwide/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- News and analyst reports say NVIDIA has faced supply and ramp-up problems when demand grew very quickly. Reporting in late 2024 noted supply bottlenecks, complex packaging steps, and a design/yield issue that slowed deliveries and forced longer ramp times into subsequent quarters. Those items are described as limiting deliveries even while demand was very high. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidias-supply-snags-hurting-deliveries-mask-booming-demand-2024-11-21/?utm_source=openai))

- Industry reports and analysts note that advanced packaging capacity (the step after wafer fabrication) is a bottleneck for very large, high‑performance NVIDIA chips. Some press reports say front-end chip production can be moved to new U.S. fabs, but the specialized packaging used for top-end NVIDIA GPUs currently remains concentrated in Taiwan, causing extra logistics and coordination steps. Other firms (including Intel and Amkor) and contract manufacturers have been discussed as additional packaging or assembly partners. ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/tsmc-is-reportedly-in-talks-with-nvidia-to-make-blackwell-gpus-in-arizona-blackwell-silicon-needs-to-be-shipped-back-to-taiwan-for-assembly?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public presentations and CEO speeches describe the company as a “full‑stack” or “platform” company that develops both hardware and software together (for example: GPUs, systems like DGX and HGX, and software such as CUDA, NeMo, and AI Enterprise). Those messages emphasize that product teams work on silicon, systems, and software as linked parts of a product offering. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gtc-keynote/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s annual report warns that bringing new products to market and getting “design wins” (agreement from large customers to use a chip design) can be a long process. The company also discloses that changes in cloud services availability, export rules, or supplier locations can change development timelines and make transitions costly and time-consuming. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- The company reports significant spending on computing infrastructure for R&D: its SEC filing shows capitalized R&D equipment and multi‑year cloud service agreements used to support development and testing. This indicates NVIDIA invests in tools and cloud capacity to move research into working products. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000029/nvda-20240128.htm))

- NVIDIA’s public materials list many external partners across the supply chain and sales channels: foundries (TSMC), packaging and assembly firms, server builders/ODM partners (Foxconn, Quanta, Inventec, Wistron), and major cloud customers (hyperscalers) that take systems built around NVIDIA chips. These partners are part of the path from research to finished products and to customers. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/TSMC-and-Synopsys-Bring-Breakthrough-NVIDIA-Computational-Lithography-Platform-to-Production/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- The company’s filings and press releases make repeated, explicit links between new technology work (for example, new GPU architectures and software libraries) and the need to coordinate with manufacturing partners, server builders and cloud providers to achieve volume production and customer deployment. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/TSMC-and-Synopsys-Bring-Breakthrough-NVIDIA-Computational-Lithography-Platform-to-Production/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Data Center was the largest end market in fiscal 2025 at $115.186 billion in revenue (the major source of company growth). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))  
- Independent device-count study reported Nvidia shipped about 3.76 million data-center GPUs in 2023, representing the vast majority of industry data-center GPU shipments in that study. ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))  
- Industry reports show NVIDIA capturing very large shares of discrete / add-in-board GPU shipments in 2025 (reported ~92% of AIB shipments in Q1 2025 and similar high shares in other quarters). High unit share implies large production volumes relative to competitors. ([gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2913039/nvidia-secures-92-gpu-market-share-in-q1-2025?utm_source=openai))  
- NVIDIA’s Blackwell GB200 NVL72 system achieved MLPerf Training v5.0 results that were up to ~2.6x faster per GPU vs. the previous generation (Hopper/H100) on several benchmarks, and NVIDIA reported the GB200 NVL72 delivered large-scale training and inference speedups in MLPerf submissions. Faster training per GPU directly reduces the time (and energy) needed to reach the same model result. ([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-blackwell-delivers-up-to-2-6x-higher-performance-in-mlperf-training-v5-0/?utm_source=openai))

([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-blackwell-delivers-massive-performance-leaps-in-mlperf-inference-v5-0/?utm_source=openai))  
- NVIDIA sells integrated data-center systems (HGX, GB200 NVL72, DGX SuperPOD). These systems combine GPUs, networking (InfiniBand/Quantum), and software in rack-scale configurations used by hyperscalers; NVIDIA documents per-rack performance and energy-efficiency claims for those systems (e.g., GB200 NVL72 claims of much higher performance per rack and energy efficiency versus prior generations). ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl2/?utm_source=openai))  
- Public customers and partners have deployed very large DGX SuperPOD or GB200-based clusters (example: SoftBank announced a DGX SuperPOD with >4,000 Blackwell GPUs), showing demand at hyperscale for NVIDIA systems. Large, concentrated deployments create volume and system-level operating efficiencies for both supplier and customer. ([softbank.jp](https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250723_01/?utm_source=openai))

Gaming (GeForce) product facts
- NVIDIA’s discrete GPU (add-in-board / AIB) market share rose to very high levels in 2025 (reports cite ~92% of AIB shipments in Q1 2025 and similar figures later), driven by the RTX 50-series and other GeForce products; high share in the gaming AIB market implies high unit volumes in that channel. ([gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2913039/nvidia-secures-92-gpu-market-share-in-q1-2025?utm_source=openai))  
- NVIDIA reported gaming revenue of $11.35 billion in fiscal 2025 (showing gaming remains a material revenue line though much smaller than Data Center). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

A large software ecosystem means many applications are tuned for NVIDIA hardware. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Unveils-Rubin-CPX-A-New-Class-of-GPU-Designed-for-Massive-Context-Inference/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))  
- NVIDIA provides many software stacks (CUDA, CUDA-X libraries, TensorRT, NeMo, NVIDIA AI Enterprise) and publishes performance-optimized libraries and frameworks that customers use to get higher throughput on NVIDIA GPUs. These software libraries are often cited in NVIDIA MLPerf submissions and product materials. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/?utm_source=openai))

Manufacturing, foundry, and packaging / supply-chain facts
- NVIDIA is a large customer of TSMC. Industry commentary and analyst estimates indicate NVIDIA accounted for a high single-digit to double-digit share of TSMC revenue in recent years and has expanded use of TSMC advanced process nodes and advanced packaging. (Analyst estimates: NVIDIA accounted for ~11% of TSMC revenue in 2023; some broker and press reports discussed NVIDIA taking a large share of TSMC advanced packaging capacity for 2025.) ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/analyst-estimates-nvidia-is-now-tsmcs-second-largest-customer-accounting-for-11-of-revenue-in-2023?utm_source=openai))  
- Media reports in 2025 cited NVIDIA pre-booking very large portions of TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity (reports quoted >60–70% of certain advanced packaging capacity for 2025 to support Blackwell and related designs). Advanced packaging is required for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and multi-die designs used in NVIDIA’s largest accelerators. ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-secures-70-of-tsmc-advanced-packaging-capacity-for-2025-taiwan-media-3885209?utm_source=openai))

Benchmark, performance-per-dollar, and energy-efficiency facts that affect operating cost
- MLPerf Training and Inference public benchmark submissions show NVIDIA Blackwell-based systems achieving large multiplicative gains (examples: up to ~2.2–2.6x faster per GPU vs. prior generation on key LLM and image models in MLPerf Training v5.0; MLPerf Inference v5.0 submissions also showed sizable per-GPU throughput gains). Faster throughput reduces compute time and energy for the same work. ([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-blackwell-delivers-up-to-2-6x-higher-performance-in-mlperf-training-v5-0/?utm_source=openai))  
- NVIDIA publishes system-level energy- and performance-efficiency claims for GB200 NVL72 and HGX platforms (for example, claims of multi-x performance per rack and energy-efficiency improvements vs prior generations on specific workloads). These published system comparisons are used by customers to estimate operating cost per model or per inference. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl2/?utm_source=openai))

Customers, partnerships, and hyperscaler facts (demand and scale)
- Major cloud providers and hyperscalers (examples include Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, SoftBank, and large cloud-native providers) have announced plans to offer or deploy NVIDIA Blackwell/HGX/GB200-based systems; public deployments and partnerships include large DGX SuperPOD rollouts. Public partnerships and hyperscaler deployments create large, repeatable orders and volume for NVIDIA products. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-google-expand-partnership-with-nvidia-blackwell-coming-to-google-cloud-in-2025-8628792?utm_source=openai))

Comparative margin and cost-related facts vs. some competitors
- NVIDIA’s consolidated gross margin for fiscal 2025 was 75.0% (GAAP). By comparison, AMD reported full-year 2024 GAAP gross margin of 49% (and non-GAAP gross margin ~53–54% in quarters of 2024–early 2025), and Intel’s 2025 quarterly gross margins were materially lower in reported quarters (Intel’s quarter-to-quarter GAAP gross margin figures were in the ~27–39% range in 2025 filings). These gross-margin differences reflect gross profit per dollar of revenue and are a financial indicator of pricing power and product mix. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

Unit-volume and market-share evidence
- Third-party reports and vendor studies in 2023–2025 repeatedly showed NVIDIA dominating data-center GPU shipments and discrete GPU shipments (examples: TechInsights reported ~98% of data-center GPU shipments in 2023; Jon Peddie Research reported ~92%+ of AIB shipments in early 2025). High unit share and shipment volumes are consistent with large manufacturing or procurement scale relative to competitors. ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))

Other supply and production-control facts
- Reports in 2025 indicated NVIDIA had reserved or contracted very large portions of server-assembly and packaging capacity with ODMs and foundry partners to produce Blackwell and related rack-scale systems, and industry articles reported NVIDIA securing major portions of specific advanced-packaging capacity and server plant capacity in Taiwan for its high-end systems. Public company statements and vendor press reported broad OEM/ODM participation in building NVIDIA-certified systems. ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/nvidia-books-entire-server-plant-capacity-through-2026-pushing-out-other-potential-customers-to-build-blackwell-and-rubin-ai-servers?utm_source=openai))

Regulatory, export-control, and inventory facts that affect costs and sales
- In April–May 2025 NVIDIA reported U.S. export licensing changes and related charges affecting certain product families (example: a reported charge associated with H20 inventory and purchase obligations was disclosed in May 2025 results), demonstrating that export controls and licensing can affect inventory, sales timing, and near-term operating costs.

## Point 16 - Question 2

**During past industry downturns, did the company remain profitable and/or gain market share while higher-cost competitors curtailed output or exited, demonstrating the leeway afforded by its lower break-even point?**

### Research Findings

- Nvidia’s fiscal year 2019 (year ended Jan. 27, 2019): the company reported full-year GAAP net income of $4.14 billion and positive earnings per share, even though the company said the quarter-ending sales were hurt by “post-crypto excess channel inventory” and weaker end markets. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2019-6747538?utm_source=openai))

- In late 2018, independent industry data showed total graphics card shipments fell and Nvidia’s share of the discrete (add‑in) GPU market rose to about 81% in Q4 2018 — meaning Nvidia sold a larger slice of a smaller market as crypto‑related demand faded. ([thinkcomputers.org](https://thinkcomputers.org/nvidia-discrete-gpu-market-share-grew-to-81-2-in-q4-2018/?utm_source=openai))

- The 2018 “crypto” downturn: major mining profitability drops led many miners to stop buying or to sell used GPUs, causing big falls in GPU prices and a sharp fall in mining-related GPU demand that year. Companies and market reports described miners exiting or cutting back. ([coindesk.com](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/08/16/nvidia-reports-substantial-decline-in-gpu-sales-to-crypto-miners?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s fiscal year 2023 (year ended Jan. 29, 2023): the company reported GAAP net income of $4.368 billion — down from the prior year but still positive — and said some gross-margin pressure and slower gaming demand had reduced profit compared with FY2022. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2023//?utm_source=openai))

- Industry shipment data in 2022–2023 showed a weak period for discrete desktop GPU shipments (some quarters were the lowest in years). During that period Nvidia’s shipment totals fell year‑over‑year but its market share in the discrete GPU market stayed around ~80% (Nvidia remained the largest seller). ([tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpu-market-healthy-and-vibrant-in-q2-2023-report?utm_source=openai))

- Nvidia’s fiscal year 2024 (year ended Jan. 28, 2024): the company reported a large revenue and profit increase (FY24 revenue $60.922 billion, GAAP net income $29.760 billion), driven by strong growth in data‑center (AI) products. This shows a later period of much higher profit after earlier weakness. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- Competitor inventory and production reactions: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) disclosed in late 2022 that it took charges (about $160 million mentioned in preliminary Q3 2022 results) mainly for inventory, pricing and related reserves, and said it was working with customers to reduce downstream inventory — an example of a competitor cutting back or writing down inventory during a market weakness. ([ir.amd.com](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1093/amd-announces-preliminary-third-quarter-2022-financial?utm_source=openai))

- Longer‑term competitor exits or product pullbacks: Intel’s first-generation Arc “Alchemist” desktop GPUs (A750, A770) and several mobile Arc SKUs were put on end‑of‑life schedules in 2025, with formal discontinuation notices and final-order dates published by Intel and reported by industry press — an example of a vendor winding down discrete GPU product lines. ([techpowerup.com](https://www.techpowerup.com/338003/intel-arc-alchemist-a750-reaches-end-of-manufacture?utm_source=openai))

- Summary data points on margins and scale (helpful to compare costs and leeway): Nvidia’s reported gross margin moved materially across years (for example, GAAP gross margin ~56.9% in FY23 and ~72.7% in FY24), showing that its per‑unit profit margins can be large when high‑value products (data‑center GPUs) are in demand. (See company fiscal results for exact numbers by year.) ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2023/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2023//?utm_source=openai))

- Market‑research context: Jon Peddie Research and other industry trackers publish quarterly reports showing that discrete GPU shipment volumes are cyclical (they can fall sharply in downturns) and that Nvidia has frequently held a large share of the discrete GPU market during several down cycles.

([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- Management described and promoted software, platform, and service initiatives (examples named: NVIDIA AI Foundry, NIMs, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NIM Agent Blueprints, Omniverse) that are intended to help customers lower their computing costs and to build recurring software/SaaS revenue. NVIDIA said software, SaaS and support revenue was approaching a $2 billion annual run rate. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA cited customer examples where its software/platforms reduced customer costs or cycle times (for example, management said Foxconn used Omniverse to reduce end‑to‑end factory cycle times by about 50%; AT&T reported cost and latency improvements after using NIMs). ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript?utm_source=openai))

- CEO Jensen Huang and company briefings reported plans for large investments in U.S. supply-chain capacity; press coverage quoted management saying the company plans very large U.S. supply‑chain investments (reported as “hundreds of billions” by the Financial Times). ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s SEC filings state the company’s manufacturing model (using foundries and external test/assembly vendors) reduces the need for large, own‑plant capital spending but also creates exposure to foundry capacity, pricing, and yield risks; the filings warn that foundry capacity is allocated on a purchase‑order basis unless specific agreements are made. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1556898/000095017024032070/ck0001556898-20231231.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s sustainability and product statements say improving product energy efficiency is a principal goal of R&D work, and the company highlights energy efficiency as a way to reduce operating cost for customers (noting NVIDIA GPUs power many of the top systems on the Green500 list). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000086/nvda-20250501.htm?utm_source=openai))

- The company reported entering multi‑year cloud service agreements and partnering with cloud service providers to host NVIDIA services (for example DGX Cloud and AI Foundry), which management presents as a path to recurring, higher‑margin revenue streams tied to its hardware and software platforms. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

**What proactive organizational restructurings (e.g., decentralization, segment realignment, new governance layers) has the company implemented in the past decade, and what objectives were cited?**

### Research Findings

- In early fiscal 2021 (reported starting Q1 FY2021) NVIDIA changed how it reports its business into two “reportable segments” named “Graphics” and “Compute & Networking.”  The company said this change matches how senior managers review results and allocate resources, and reflects a shift toward data-center and networking work alongside graphics. ([secinfo.com](https://www.secinfo.com/dvT9t.g5.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA announced and completed the purchase of Mellanox (deal announced March 11, 2019; closed April 27, 2020).  After the deal the company combined Mellanox networking products with NVIDIA’s compute products so it could offer end-to-end data‑center technology (chips, networking, and software).  The company described the objective as raising performance, utilization and scale for next‑generation data centers. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion/?utm_source=openai))

- Following the Mellanox work, NVIDIA created and promoted a BlueField “DPU” product line (BlueField‑2, BlueField‑3, etc.) and associated software (DOCA).  DPUs are network/ I/O processors that take infrastructure work off the main CPU.  NVIDIA said the goal was to speed networking, storage and security tasks, free CPU cores for applications, and make data centers more secure and efficient. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/releases-20210113-6829469?utm_source=openai))

- In March 2021 NVIDIA launched “NVIDIA AI Enterprise,” a packaged software suite and partner program (not a legal reorganization but a formal new product/business initiative).  The stated objective was to let ordinary companies run AI on their existing servers, speed up AI development, and make enterprise IT able to manage AI workloads (including a close integration with VMware). ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/09/2189505/0/en/NVIDIA-Unveils-AI-Enterprise-Software-Suite-to-Help-Every-Industry-Unlock-the-Power-of-AI.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s senior leader (CEO Jensen Huang) has publicly described an unusually flat reporting approach: he said in 2023 that he has roughly 50 direct reports.  He explained this is deliberate so there are fewer management layers, information flows faster, and leaders are empowered to act—i.e., an intentional move to flatten the company’s management structure. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-has-50-direct-reports-2023-11?utm_source=openai))

- The company has described “board refreshment” and changes to board committee assignments over recent years (appointment of new directors since 2020, regular rotation of committee membership, and adoption of proxy‑access rules).  NVIDIA said these moves were intended to bring new perspectives, governance skills, and oversight as the company grows into new markets and faces greater geopolitical and regulatory complexity. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public filings from 2024–2025 show the “Compute & Networking” segment became the company’s main revenue and operating‑income driver after the segment realignment and after Mellanox and data‑center product ramps.  The filings present this redefined segment as the group that includes data‑center GPUs, Mellanox networking, DPUs, and related software—indicating the company’s objective to organize around accelerated computing plus networking for AI/data‑center customers.

## Point 17 - Question 3

**Which new business lines, technologies, or geographic markets has the company entered ahead of peers, illustrating deliberate pivots rather than defensive reactions?**

### Research Findings

- In 2007 NVIDIA released CUDA, a software toolkit that let ordinary programmers use graphics chips (GPUs) for general-purpose computing instead of only drawing pictures. This made GPUs useful for scientific computing and machine learning. ([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-1?utm_source=openai))

- In 2016–2017 NVIDIA pushed into large-scale AI data centers with purpose-built systems and GPU architectures: it launched the DGX line (a ready-made “AI supercomputer” appliance) in 2016 and the Volta GPU (with specialized “tensor” cores for AI math) in 2017 to speed training and inference. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-world-s-first-deep-learning-supercomputer?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA moved from selling individual GPUs to offering full hardware+software systems for AI (GPUs, networking, preinstalled frameworks and appliances like DGX), so customers could buy a complete AI server rather than assemble one themselves. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-a100./?utm_source=openai))

- In 2019 NVIDIA bought Mellanox, a company that makes high‑speed network adapters and switches used inside data centers. That added networking products to NVIDIA’s offerings so it could sell both compute (GPUs) and the data-center networking that links them. ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2019/03/11/1751087/0/en/NVIDIA-to-Acquire-Mellanox-for-6-9-Billion.html?utm_source=openai))

- After the Mellanox purchase, NVIDIA developed BlueField “DPUs” (data‑processing units). A DPU is a network card with a small computer on it that can take networking, storage and security work off the main CPUs, improving data‑center efficiency. NVIDIA announced BlueField‑2/BlueField‑3 and positioned them for cloud and hyperscaler use. ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/05/2103595/0/en/NVIDIA-Introduces-New-Family-of-BlueField-DPUs-to-Bring-Breakthrough-Networking-Storage-and-Security-Performance-to-Every-Data-Center.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA created a family of data‑center CPUs and CPU+GPU “superchips” called Grace and Grace Hopper (GH200). These are NVIDIA‑designed processors for servers that share memory with NVIDIA GPUs, aimed at very large AI and scientific workloads. ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/03/22/2407898/0/en/NVIDIA-Introduces-Grace-CPU-Superchip.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA expanded into enterprise AI software and tools (not just chips). It launched NVIDIA AI Enterprise (a certified software stack for running AI on standard servers) and provided toolkits for model building, speech and vision (examples: NeMo, Riva, Clara, Morpheus), so customers could run and manage AI workloads with NVIDIA software. ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/09/2189505/0/en/NVIDIA-Unveils-AI-Enterprise-Software-Suite-to-Help-Every-Industry-Unlock-the-Power-of-AI.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA invested in cloud gaming as a new product line (GeForce NOW). It built and rented GPU capacity to stream PC games to many devices and later struck long-term content and distribution deals (for example a 10‑year agreement with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW). GeForce NOW has been offered in many countries. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-the-next-generation-in-cloud-gaming/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA pushed into digital‑twin and 3D simulation software with Omniverse, a platform for building and running realistic, shared 3D worlds for design, factories and robotics. It created a purpose-built OVX system (a server design) to run large industrial simulations and partnered with industrial software firms (for example Siemens) to use Omniverse for factory and product digital twins. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-data-center-scale-omniverse-computing-system-for-industrial-digital-twins?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA moved into the automotive market with its DRIVE platform (first DRIVE announcements in 2015–2016). DRIVE is an in‑car AI computer and software stack used by carmakers and suppliers; NVIDIA later announced long-term partnerships with many automakers and suppliers to build next‑generation vehicles on DRIVE. ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/01/05/1149656/0/en/NVIDIA-Paves-Way-for-Tomorrow-s-Cars-With-NVIDIA-DRIVE-Automotive-Computers.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA pursued an “end‑to‑end” data‑center strategy: GPUs for AI, Mellanox networking, BlueField DPUs, DGX systems, and NVIDIA software (CUDA, AI Enterprise, toolkits). The company framed these pieces as a combined platform for cloud, enterprise and research AI workloads. ([globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2019/03/11/1751087/0/en/NVIDIA-to-Acquire-Mellanox-for-6-9-Billion.html?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA secured commercial partnerships and customer commitments across cloud and enterprise providers (examples: long-term deals or integrations with Microsoft, VMware, Oracle and many cloud providers), showing adoption of NVIDIA hardware/software across major data‑center operators. ([news.microsoft.com](https://news.microsoft.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-and-nvidia-announce-expansive-new-gaming-deal/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA expanded its product reach into specialized hardware categories beyond traditional GPUs: smart network adapters (ConnectX/SmartNIC), DPUs (BlueField), and full server CPUs (Grace), each announced as distinct product families with technical and customer adoption details. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/releases-20210113-6829469?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s technology and products have been adopted in multiple geographic markets and sectors: examples include cloud and AI deployments worldwide (DGX and Grace Hopper supercomputers in Europe, US research centers), automotive projects in China (Baidu) and global automaker partnerships (Mercedes, Toyota and others), and consumer cloud gaming availability in many countries. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Grace-Hopper-Ignites-New-Era-of-AI-Supercomputing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA has repeatedly introduced specialized GPU features for AI (for example Tensor Cores in Volta) and then built software libraries so developers could use those features (cuDNN, TensorRT and the CUDA ecosystem). This created a large developer base tied to NVIDIA’s hardware. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-revolutionary-volta-gpu-platform-fueling-next-era-of-ai-and-high-performance-computing?utm_source=openai))

## Point 17 - Question 4

**What mechanisms (innovation programs, profit-and-loss responsibility, incentive systems) demonstrate that employees at multiple levels are empowered to propose and execute change?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA gives many employees stock awards called restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs), and market-based PSUs under its equity plans. RSUs usually vest over several years; PSUs only pay out if set performance goals are met. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company’s filings say PSUs and market-based PSUs vest only when the company’s compensation committee determines performance or market conditions have been met. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA operates an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Employees can buy company shares at a discount (price = 85% of a formula based on start or purchase date). From March 2025 the plan allowed employees to withhold up to 25% of pay to buy stock (the Board can change this). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s public filings show large stock-based compensation for employees (stock-based compensation expense reported as about $4,737 million for fiscal 2025). This means equity pay is a major part of employee incentives. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- News reports described a one-time “Jensen special grant” (April 2024) that gave employees an extra ~25% in RSUs on top of their normal equity refreshes; the reports said the grant vests over four years. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jensen-huang-stock-boost-employees-special-grant-2024-4?utm_source=openai))

- In its annual report, NVIDIA says it organizes business into reportable segments and measures each segment by revenue and operating income. The company’s CEO is named the chief operating decision maker (CODM) who reviews segment revenue and segment operating income. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company publishes operating income by segment (for example, Compute & Networking operating income and Graphics operating income are reported separately in the annual report). This shows the company tracks financial results at the segment level. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA hosts and runs developer hackathons (for example, DOCA and DPU hackathons). These events invite teams to build prototypes, use NVIDIA tools, and are judged or mentored by NVIDIA engineers and executives. The hackathons are open to a wide range of participants, including developers and partners. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/doca-hackathon/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA runs GTC, a large developer and research conference. GTC features thousands of sessions, company keynotes (CEO Jensen Huang), hands-on demos and training where engineers, researchers and developers present work and new ideas. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-industry-visionaries-to-unveil-whats-next-in-ai-at-gtc-2025?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA Research operates multiple labs (for example, a Tel-Aviv research lab) that publish papers and describe active research projects. These labs show the company supports employee-led, long‑term research work inside NVIDIA. ([research.nvidia.com](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/?utm_source=openai))

- The company runs external startup and developer programs (for example, NVIDIA Inception for startups and developer training through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute). These programs give technical help, training, and resources to outside teams and show a company-wide emphasis on building and testing new ideas. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA runs regional innovation and partnership programs and joint research centers with universities (examples include the NVIDIA AI Tech Community and joint centers with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh). These programs create staffed centers and projects that bring NVIDIA engineers, university researchers, and local partners together to try new ideas. ([blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/pittsburgh-ai-tech-community/?utm_source=openai))

## Point 17 - Question 5

**During periods of significant industry disruption or regulatory shifts, what timely strategic actions—such as divestitures, acquisitions, or operational overhauls—did the company undertake, and what outcomes followed?**

### Research Findings

- NVDA is the stock ticker for NVIDIA Corporation. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/investor-resources/faqs/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- In 2006–2007 NVIDIA opened its GPUs to run general-purpose programs (the CUDA software and the Tesla product family). This was a big operational shift from only making chips for graphics to selling chips and software for science, servers and later AI. The change let many researchers and data centers use NVIDIA chips for heavy math tasks. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/?utm_source=openai))

- In May–June 2011 NVIDIA bought Icera, a maker of phone modem chips, for about $367 million to try to supply both application processors and modems for phones. In May 2015 NVIDIA announced it would wind down (close) the Icera modem operations and look to sell the technology, saying the company would instead partner with other modem suppliers and focus on higher-growth areas like gaming, automotive and cloud computing. NVIDIA said the wind-down would cause restructuring charges (it estimated $100–$125 million of charges linked to the wind-down at the time). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-baseband-and-rf-technology-leader-icera-6622925?utm_source=openai))

- In March 2019 NVIDIA agreed to buy Mellanox (networking and interconnect hardware) for about $6.9 billion; that deal closed in April 2020. NVIDIA said the purpose was to combine its compute chips with Mellanox’s fast networking to build stronger, end-to-end data‑center products. After the acquisition, NVIDIA’s “Compute & Networking” / data-center business grew substantially in the following years. Chinese regulators later opened an antitrust probe into the 2020 Mellanox deal (investigation reported in late 2024/2025). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion/?utm_source=openai))

- In September 2020 NVIDIA agreed to buy Arm, a major chip‑design company, but the deal ran into regulatory reviews and opposition around the world. U.S. and other regulators raised antitrust and national‑security concerns; the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger. NVIDIA and SoftBank terminated the deal in February 2022 because of the heavy regulatory scrutiny; NVIDIA paid a prepayment/break fee that SoftBank kept under the agreement, and Arm moved toward an initial public offering. ([group.softbank](https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20220208?utm_source=openai))

- During cryptocurrency booms (notably 2017–2018 and again in 2020–2021), demand for NVIDIA gaming GPUs from miners caused product shortages and market disruption. NVIDIA responded in 2021 by introducing: (1) CMP — separate “cryptocurrency‑mining processor” products sold through partners so regular GeForce cards would be less used by miners; and (2) “Lite Hash Rate” (LHR) versions of some GeForce cards that reduced Ethereum‑mining performance to discourage miners buying gaming cards. CMP sales were modest and then fell quickly; NVIDIA said CMP revenue was small relative to total sales and later quarters showed steep declines in CMP sales. Legal and investor scrutiny followed—investors later brought suits alleging NVIDIA under‑disclosed crypto exposure; some of those cases reached higher courts. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/nvidia-cryptocurrency-mining-processor-for-ether-announced.html?utm_source=openai))

- From 2022 onwards, U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips created regulatory limits on what NVIDIA could sell into China. NVIDIA modified some products to comply with earlier limits (for example creating China‑specific variants called A800 and H800 with reduced communications or other differences so they met the original U.S. controls). That approach let NVIDIA continue some sales into China for a time. Later tightening of U.S. export rules (including new measures announced in 2023 and 2025) put further limits on those modified chips and on newer models (for example the H20), and NVIDIA reported large charges and lost China revenue tied to those restrictions (NVIDIA reported a multi‑billion‑dollar charge in its April 2025 quarter related to H20 export licensing requirements and estimated further lost revenue). ([euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/08/usa-china-chips-nvidia?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s strategic moves into data‑center networking, GPU compute software and AI hardware (examples above) correspond with very large growth in its data‑center revenue after about 2019–2020; the company’s public filings and third‑party data show data‑center revenue rising from under $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to many times that amount in later years as AI adoption expanded. ([gpueconomics.com](https://www.gpueconomics.com/blog/nvidia-data-center-revenue?utm_source=openai))

- Regulatory actions and investigations have followed some of NVIDIA’s major moves: the U.S. FTC sued to block the Arm takeover in 2021; Chinese authorities opened an antitrust probe related to the Mellanox acquisition in late 2024/2025; and U.S. export‑control changes in 2022–2025 forced NVIDIA to redesign product offerings for China and caused material financial charges and lost sales. ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger?utm_source=openai))

- Outcomes summarized as plain facts:
  - CUDA and the Tesla compute product line changed NVIDIA from a pure graphics chip seller into a supplier for scientific computing and AI; this underpins much of NVIDIA’s later data‑center growth. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/about-nvidia/corporate-timeline/?utm_source=openai))
  - The Icera purchase (2011) ended with a wind‑down (2015) after NVIDIA refocused on higher‑growth businesses. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-baseband-and-rf-technology-leader-icera-6622925?utm_source=openai))
  - The Mellanox purchase (2019–2020) was completed and was used to build NVIDIA’s data‑center networking capability; regulators later questioned compliance with conditions in China, prompting an investigation. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-completes-acquisition-of-mellanox-creating-major-force-driving-next-gen-data-centers?nvid=nv-int-cwmfg-36277&utm_source=openai))
  - The Arm acquisition attempt (2020–2022) was stopped by regulators and the deal was terminated; NVIDIA paid the agreed prepayment/break fee and Arm pursued an IPO instead. ([group.softbank](https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20220208?utm_source=openai))
  - Efforts to limit GPU use for crypto mining (CMP and LHR in 2021) reduced miner demand for some GeForce cards but did not eliminate mining interest; CMP revenue was small and fell quickly. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/nvidia-cryptocurrency-mining-processor-for-ether-announced.html?utm_source=openai))
  - U.S. export controls forced NVIDIA to make product changes for China (A800/H800) and later to take significant charges and lose projected H20 sales after tighter controls in 2025. ([euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/08/usa-china-chips-nvidia?utm_source=openai))

  - Intel: public data show substantially lower gross margins in recent years versus NVIDIA and many fabless peers; average gross margin for 2024 reported in public financial datasets was about the high‑30s percent range (Intel is an integrated device manufacturer with higher manufacturing cost burdens). Intel’s margins vary by quarter and year in its 10‑K/earnings releases. ([m.macrotrends.net](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/gross-margin?utm_source=openai))
  - Broadcom: gross margins in recent periods have been in the mid‑60s percent range (Broadcom is a high‑margin networking/ASIC/fabless products company). ([m.macrotrends.net](https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AVGO/broadcom/gross-margin?utm_source=openai))
  - Qualcomm and other large fabless ASIC/SoC vendors: gross margins commonly in the high‑40s to mid‑50s percent range in recent public filings. (See company filings and financial data providers for exact quarter/year figures.) ([macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/QCOM/qualcomm/gross-margin?utm_source=openai))

- Industry structure fact useful for margin comparison: “fabless” semiconductor companies (design only, outsource manufacturing and packaging) generally report higher gross margins than integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that run their own fabs, because fabless firms avoid large factory capital and operating costs. This pattern is documented in industry analyses. ([eetimes.com](https://www.eetimes.com/fabless-firms-outpace-idms-in-costs-gross-margins/?utm_source=openai))

- Recent or prospective entrants (examples) and reported cost or price claims:
  - Cerebras Systems (wafer‑scale AI chip maker): announced an inference service in Aug 2024 claiming pricing as low as $0.10 per million tokens for certain Llama models; Cerebras has also reported revenues and losses in public coverage (example: reported $136 million revenue with a $67 million loss in H1 2024 in media reporting). Cerebras has pitched lower token‑cost pricing for inference versus GPU cloud prices. ([bigdatawire.com](https://www.bigdatawire.com/this-just-in/cerebras-introduces-inference-service-touting-speed-and-cost-benefits/?utm_source=openai))
  - Graphcore (IPU maker): published system pricing for a 1U M2000 system at about $32,450 (four MK2 IPUs) and publicly compared cluster price‑performance to NVIDIA DGX systems in vendor materials and press coverage; Graphcore has reported operating losses in prior company filings. ([crn.com](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/chip-startup-graphcore-takes-on-nvidia-a100-with-new-ipu?utm_source=openai))
  - Other entrants (examples: SambaNova, Tenstorrent, Habana/Intel, Google TPUs) have announced products, claimed different price‑performance or efficiency numbers, or made design‑level cost claims; many are private or report performance/pricing case studies rather than audited cost of goods. Public reporting varies by vendor. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/cerebras-launches-ai-inference-tool-challenge-nvidia-2024-08-27/?utm_source=openai))

- Evidence on entrants’ financials: several AI‑chip startups have reported operating losses while scaling (public articles note Graphcore and Cerebras reported multi‑hundred‑million dollar losses or were loss‑making while growing revenue). This means entrants’ reported “cost structures” are often stated as price/performance claims or pilot pricing, not long‑run, audited per‑unit cost disclosures. ([electronicsweekly.com](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/graphcore-has-loss-of-204m-2023-10/?utm_source=openai))

- Items you would need to compute or compare “unit cost” precisely (these are reported numbers you can combine):
  - NVIDIA reported cost of revenue (examples: FY25 $32,639M; Q2 FY26 $12,890M). ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2025/default.aspx))
  - Industry unit‑shipment estimates come from market research firms (example: TechInsights estimate of ~3.76 million NVIDIA datacenter GPUs shipped in 2023). NVIDIA itself does not publish a consistent, company‑wide “units shipped” metric for all GPUs. ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))
  - Peers’ reported gross profit and revenues (examples: AMD FY2024 gross profit/margin, Intel and Broadcom gross margins) are available in each company’s filings and market summaries; those numbers let you compute peer operating margins and gross margins for direct comparison.

## Point 18 - Question 2

**What specific scale advantages (e.g., high fixed-cost leverage, proprietary processes, vertical integration, preferential supplier terms) underpin the company’s costs?**

### Research Findings

- Company name and filings: NVIDIA Corporation (ticker: NVDA). Annual report (Form 10‑K) and investor releases contain the company’s official financial and operational facts. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA is a “fabless” chip company: it designs chips but does not run the factories that make the silicon wafers. It contracts foundries and subcontractors to manufacture, assemble, test, and package its products. This means NVIDIA depends on outside makers for actual chip production. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Primary foundry and packaging partners: NVIDIA works closely with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for advanced silicon processes and with other suppliers (including Samsung and SK Hynix) for memory and packaging services. NVIDIA and TSMC have co‑developed production tools and processes for NVIDIA’s advanced chips. ([pr.tsmc.com](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/1236?utm_source=openai))

- Large long‑term purchase and capacity commitments: as of January 26, 2025 NVIDIA reported $30.8 billion of outstanding inventory purchase and long‑term supply and capacity obligations (a significant portion tied to new product introductions). The company also reported billions in prepaid supply and capacity agreements. These commitments are used to secure future supply and capacity from contract manufacturers and suppliers. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Industry reporting of reserved advanced‑packaging capacity: multiple industry sources reported that NVIDIA pre‑booked a large share of TSMC’s advanced CoWoS (chip‑on‑wafer‑on‑substrate) packaging capacity for 2025—reports cite shares in the 60–70% range. Such pre‑bookings let NVIDIA secure scarce advanced packaging slots used for high‑end AI GPUs. ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-secures-70-of-tsmc-advanced-packaging-capacity-for-2025-taiwan-media-3885209?utm_source=openai))

- High fixed‑cost investment in R&D and engineering: NVIDIA’s Form 10‑K shows research and development expense of about $12.9 billion for fiscal 2025. Large, upfront R&D and engineering costs are typical in chip design; once these fixed costs are paid, each extra unit sold spreads those costs thinner. ([fintel.io](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-nvidia-corp-1045810-10k-2025-february-26-20145-3358?utm_source=openai))

- Operating and gross margin leverage tied to product mix: NVIDIA reported a 75.0% gross margin for fiscal 2025, and the company states that a higher share of data‑center (AI) product revenue helped drive margin expansion. Higher‑margin software and data‑center products raise overall margins as sales scale. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Proprietary software and developer ecosystem (switching cost): NVIDIA develops and controls CUDA (its parallel‑compute software platform and libraries), plus related toolkits (cuDNN, TensorRT, etc.). CUDA is proprietary and widely used; NVIDIA has promoted a large registered developer base and many GPU‑accelerated applications. A large installed base of CUDA‑compatible software and trained developers raises the practical cost for customers to move to a different vendor. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA?utm_source=openai))

- Vertical integration via acquisitions and product lines: NVIDIA acquired Mellanox (completed April 2020) to bring high‑performance networking and switch products into the company. That acquisition added NICs, switches, and software that NVIDIA now sells alongside its GPUs. This lets NVIDIA offer end‑to‑end data‑center solutions (compute + networking). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-completes-acquisition-of-mellanox-creating-major-force-driving-next-gen-data-centers?nvid=nv-int-cwmfg-36277&utm_source=openai))

- Proprietary interconnects and system‑level products: NVIDIA develops its own high‑speed GPU interconnects (NVLink and NVLink Switch) and integrates them into full systems (for example, DGX servers and DGX SuperPODs). Those interconnects are built into NVIDIA’s rack and supercomputer products to enable large, tightly coupled multi‑GPU systems. Selling integrated hardware + interconnect + software bundles increases value for customers and makes alternative replacements harder. ([nvidia.com](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/?utm_source=openai))

- Product and service bundles (full‑stack offerings): NVIDIA packages chips with its software, reference systems, and managed solutions (examples: DGX systems, DGX SuperPOD, NIM microservices, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software). Bundling hardware with optimized software and services raises overall margins and strengthens customer dependence on NVIDIA’s stack. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Launches-Blackwell-Powered-DGX-SuperPOD-for-Generative-AI-Supercomputing-at-Trillion-Parameter-Scale/?utm_source=openai))

- Use of advanced packaging and multi‑chip modules to scale performance: NVIDIA uses advanced packaging technologies (e.g., TSMC CoWoS, 2.5D/3D packaging, HBM memory stacks) to combine multiple chiplets and memory into one package. This approach lets NVIDIA achieve higher performance while reusing design blocks across products, supporting scale and faster product iteration. ([trendforce.com](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/05/06/news-tsmcs-advanced-packaging-capacity-fully-booked-by-nvidia-and-amd-through-next-year/?utm_source=openai))

- Purchase obligations and non‑cancellable orders: NVIDIA’s filings note that it places non‑cancellable and non‑returnable purchase orders and sometimes prepays suppliers; these actions can secure supply but also create inventory and commitment risks. The 10‑K explicitly warns that purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and can affect gross margin and flexibility. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

## Point 18 - Question 3

**What evidence shows that management continually invests to enhance efficiency and defend cost advantages amid technological change or shifting input prices?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA reported research and development (R&D) expense of $12,914 million for fiscal year 2025, up from $8,675 million in fiscal year 2024. The company said the FY2025 R&D increase was driven by a 32% rise in compensation and benefits, a 100% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 234% increase in engineering development costs for new product introductions. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA spent about $3.4 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025 (versus $1.1 billion in FY2024). The company also disclosed purchases related to property, equipment and intangible assets of $3,236 million and said it expects to increase capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- Net cash used in investing activities was $20,421 million in fiscal year 2025, with the company saying this was driven mainly by net purchases of marketable securities and purchases of land, property and equipment. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA completed the acquisition of Mellanox in April 2020. The company said combining its GPUs with Mellanox’s networking technology lets NVIDIA optimize compute, networking and storage together to improve data‑center performance and lower operating cost. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-completes-acquisition-of-mellanox-creating-major-force-driving-next-gen-data-centers?nvid=nv-int-cwmfg-36277&utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s BlueField DPUs (from the Mellanox product line) are designed to offload networking, storage and security tasks from the CPU. NVIDIA and partners report that BlueField DPUs reduce CPU work and can cut server power and operating cost (for example, tests showing power reductions and claims that a BlueField DPU can replace dozens of CPU cores for infrastructure tasks). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-new-family-of-bluefield-dpus-to-bring-breakthrough-networking-storage-and-security-performance-to-every-data-center?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA uses third‑party foundries (for example, TSMC and Samsung) to make wafers and uses advanced packaging technology (CoWoS) for its high-end GPUs. Company filings and interviews show NVIDIA is changing packaging approaches (for example, moving to larger CoWoS-L packaging for newer Blackwell chips) to increase capacity and meet demand. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- The company reported provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations of $3.7 billion in fiscal 2025, and it disclosed outstanding inventory purchase and long‑term supply and capacity obligations totaling $30.8 billion as of January 26, 2025. The 10‑K notes these obligations support new product introductions (including Blackwell). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA reported gross margin of 75.0% for fiscal year 2025, up from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024, and said the increase was mainly due to a higher mix of data‑center revenue. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA describes the Blackwell platform (its newest data‑center architecture) as delivering much higher performance per GPU and lower energy and operating cost for AI workloads. Company material cites examples such as multi‑fold performance gains on benchmark tests and claims of substantial reductions in cost and energy for certain rack‑scale Blackwell systems. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Platform-Arrives-to-Power-a-New-Era-of-Computing/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA builds and sells software, developer tools, and cloud services that work with its chips (for example, CUDA libraries, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, DGX systems, and DGX Cloud). NVIDIA states its developer ecosystem spans millions of developers and thousands of CUDA applications, which the company presents as a long‑lived asset that helps customers get more value from NVIDIA hardware over time. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Unveils-Rubin-CPX-A-New-Class-of-GPU-Designed-for-Massive-Context-Inference/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA lists multi‑year cloud service agreements and other non‑inventory purchase obligations of $14.3 billion, including $10.9 billion of multi‑year cloud service agreements, showing contractual ties to cloud customers and partners to deploy its systems and software at scale. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

## Point 18 - Question 4

**What is the company’s current market share? Over the past decade, what investigations, enforcement actions, or consent decrees have been initiated by antitrust authorities (U.S. DOJ, FTC, European Commission, or other jurisdictions), and what were their outcomes?**

### Research Findings

Market-share facts (by market segment; simple language, with dates and sources)

- Discrete (add‑in‑board / desktop) GPUs — latest industry analyst numbers:
  - Jon Peddie Research reported that Nvidia held about 94% of global discrete (add‑in‑board) GPU shipments in Q2 2025. ([jonpeddie.com](https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q225-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-increased-27-0-from-last-quarter/?utm_source=openai))

- Data‑center / AI training GPUs — unit and revenue shares reported by industry analysts:
  - A TechInsights study reported Nvidia shipped ~3.76 million data‑center GPU units in 2023, representing about a 98% share of data‑center GPU unit shipments and ~98% of data‑center GPU revenue in 2023 (study published mid‑2024). ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))
  - Independent analyst firms (Omdia and others) have published estimates in 2024–2025 showing Nvidia with a very large share (commonly reported in the range of roughly 70–90% for high‑end/data‑center AI GPUs depending on the metric and year); different firms use different methods (units, boards, revenue or “BOM” share). ([omdia.tech.informa.com](https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2025/aug/ai-data-center-chip-market-to-hit-286bn-growth-likely-peaking-as-custom-asics-gain-ground?utm_source=openai))

- Broader AI‑accelerator / high‑performance AI chip market (industry estimates):
  - Multiple market reports in 2024–2025 described Nvidia as the dominant supplier of GPUs used for large AI models and data‑center AI, often citing market shares well above other vendors for high‑end training GPUs. Exact percentages vary by report and by whether the measure is units, revenue, or “performance dollars.” ([monexa.ai](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/nvidia-s-ai-dominance-unpacking-growth-multi-trill-NVDA-2025-06-25?utm_source=openai))

Antitrust investigations, enforcement actions, and merger reviews involving Nvidia (2015–2025) — plain facts, authority, short description, and outcome or status

1) Proposed acquisition of Arm Ltd. (SoftBank → Nvidia), 2020–2022
   - What happened: Nvidia announced it would buy Arm (Sept 2020 / announced 2020–2021 filings). Regulators in several places reviewed the deal. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a formal lawsuit to block the transaction on Dec 2, 2021. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) referred the deal for an in‑depth (Phase 2) investigation in November 2021. The European Commission opened an in‑depth probe in October 2021. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/nvidias-takeover-of-arm-faces-in-depth-investigation-in-europe.html?utm_source=openai))
   - Outcome: Nvidia and SoftBank terminated the proposed deal in February 2022. The FTC dismissed its administrative complaint after the parties ended the transaction. The CMA cancelled its Phase 2 inquiry when the transaction was abandoned. ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2110015-nvidiaarm-matter?utm_source=openai))

2) Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies (announced 2019, closed April 2020) — later Chinese antitrust review and investigation
   - What happened in 2019–2020: Nvidia announced and completed its purchase of Mellanox (transaction closed April 27, 2020). China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) approved the deal subject to specific conditions (including requirements about fair, reasonable, non‑discriminatory supply and certain information‑sharing obligations). ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion?utm_source=openai))
   - Later investigation (December 2024 → 2025): Chinese regulators opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia in December 2024 focused on compliance with the conditions attached to the Mellanox approval. In September 2025 SAMR publicly said its preliminary review found Nvidia had violated China’s Anti‑Monopoly Law and announced a further investigation (preliminary finding reported by SAMR). As of the SAMR statement, further investigation was ongoing and possible fines or remedies had not been finalized. ([digitimes.com](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241210VL200/nvidia-investigation-antitrust-war-probe.html?utm_source=openai))

3) French Autorité de la concurrence (France) — dawn raid and investigation into graphics‑cards / cloud practices (2023–2024)
   - What happened: In September 2023 French competition authorities carried out unannounced inspections (dawn raids) in the graphics‑card sector; press reports identified Nvidia as a target of the inspections. The Autorité later confirmed an investigation into alleged anti‑competitive practices connected to chips used for cloud and AI. In mid‑2024 French authorities said they were preparing or could issue formal charges (a “statement of objections”) if the investigation warranted it. ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23894863/nvidia-offices-raided-french-competition-authority?utm_source=openai))
   - Outcome / status (as of Oct 7, 2025): The French investigation had been ongoing; press and regulator statements indicated possible charges were being prepared or could be issued, but there was no public final sanction or consent decree announced by that date. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-antitrust-regulators-preparing-nvidia-charges-sources-say-2024-07-01/?utm_source=openai))

4) United States — Department of Justice (DOJ) and other U.S. scrutiny (2024–2025)
   - What happened: In mid‑2024 U.S. authorities (DOJ) and the FTC discussed dividing oversight of large AI‑ecosystem players. In mid‑2024 the DOJ began an antitrust inquiry focused on Nvidia’s role in the AI‑chip market; media reports from August 2024 said DOJ was investigating allegations from competitors that Nvidia used its market position in ways that could harm competition (questions about whether Nvidia conditioned purchases, bundled products, or charged higher prices for networking gear to customers who bought rival chips). The DOJ also reviewed Nvidia’s acquisition of Run:ai (see item 6). Nvidia publicly said it had not been subpoenaed at certain points and that it would cooperate with regulators. ([politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/06/federal-antitrust-probes-nvidia-microsoft-openai-00161973?utm_source=openai))
   - Outcome / status (as of Oct 7, 2025): Reports described ongoing DOJ inquiries; no public DOJ enforcement action (a filed antitrust lawsuit or final consent decree against Nvidia) had been announced by that date. (Separately, Nvidia’s Run:ai acquisition completed after EU clearance — see item 6.) ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-faces-us-doj-probe-over-complaints-rivals-information-reports-2024-08-02/?utm_source=openai))

5) European Commission / EU‑level probes of Nvidia selling practices (2024–2025)
   - What happened: In late 2024 the European Commission sent questionnaires and carried out fact‑finding about whether Nvidia tied or bundled its GPUs with other products (for example, networking gear) and whether that practice could harm competition. The EU also examined Nvidia’s acquisition of Run:ai after an Article 22 referral from Italy. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-watchdog-probes-nvidia-hardware-bundling-it-scrutinises-runai-deal-2024-12-04/?utm_source=openai))
   - Outcome / status:
     - On the Run:ai deal: the European Commission concluded in December 2024 that the acquisition raised no competition concerns in the EEA and approved it unconditionally; Nvidia closed the Run:ai deal in late December 2024. (Italy had referred the deal to the Commission under Article 22; Nvidia later filed a legal challenge in 2025 about the referral process.) ([competition.today](https://competition.today/2024/12/21/eu-approves-nvidias-acquisition-of-runai-labs/?utm_source=openai))
     - On broader EU selling‑practices queries: the Commission’s fact‑finding and questionnaires were described in press reports in late 2024 and 2025; as of Oct 7, 2025 that activity had led to information requests and scrutiny but no publicly announced EU final penalties or consent decrees against Nvidia. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-watchdog-probes-nvidia-hardware-bundling-it-scrutinises-runai-deal-2024-12-04/?utm_source=openai))

6) Run:ai acquisition (2024) — multiple regulators’ scrutiny
   - What happened: Nvidia announced an agreement to buy Run:ai (April 2024). Regulators in the EU and the U.S. reviewed the transaction; the European Commission formally reviewed the deal after an Article 22 referral and cleared it unconditionally on Dec 20, 2024. The U.S. DOJ conducted antitrust inquiries into the same purchase, reported in 2024, but the deal closed (reported Dec 30, 2024). Some press coverage said DOJ had inquiries but did not block the transaction. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-watchdog-probes-nvidia-hardware-bundling-it-scrutinises-runai-deal-2024-12-04/?utm_source=openai))

7) Requests for information and preliminary inquiries by other national regulators (2023–2025)
   - What happened: Press reports and Nvidia filings state that regulators in several jurisdictions (European Union, United Kingdom, China, South Korea and others) asked Nvidia for information about its products, sales practices, investments and partnerships in 2023–2025. In some cases, regulators conducted dawn raids, sent questionnaires, or opened formal preliminary reviews. These activities were fact‑finding or preliminary investigatory steps.

   - Outcome / status: Most country‑level inquiries reported in 2023–2025 were at evidence‑gathering or investigation stages as of Oct 7, 2025; some (China’s SAMR) later issued preliminary findings (see item 2). ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23894863/nvidia-offices-raided-french-competition-authority?utm_source=openai))

8) Final fines, consent decrees, or court orders (summary for 2015–Oct 7, 2025)
   - Fact: Public records and regulator press releases show major merger enforcement actions (notably the FTC’s suit to block the Arm deal, and the multi‑jurisdictional inquiry that led to termination of that deal) and multiple ongoing or completed merger reviews (for Mellanox in 2020, Run:ai in 2024). As of Oct 7, 2025 there was no widely reported final U.S. court judgment, U.S. final consent decree, or EU final fine publicly announced against Nvidia for core antitrust abuses during the 2015–2025 period, except:
     - The FTC’s administrative complaint against the proposed Arm acquisition (filed Dec 2, 2021) was dismissed after the parties terminated the Arm transaction (Feb 2022). ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger?utm_source=openai))
     - China’s SAMR had opened an investigation in Dec 2024 and in Sept 2025 reported a preliminary finding that Nvidia violated Chinese anti‑monopoly rules in connection with the Mellanox transaction; that investigation was continuing and any final sanctions or remedies had not been announced as of Oct 7, 2025.

## Point 18 - Question 5

**What disclosures (legal reserves, risk factors, lobbying expenditures, contingency plans) indicate management’s expectations about future antitrust scrutiny?**

### Research Findings

- NVIDIA says regulators have asked for wide information about its business and sales, including questions about GPU sales, how it allocates supply, its investments and partnerships for foundation models, its contracts with customers and suppliers, and its product strategies. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA tells investors it has received broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s filings state the French Competition Authority specifically collected information from NVIDIA about its business in graphics cards and cloud service provider markets as part of an ongoing inquiry. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- NVIDIA’s filings say it expects to receive additional requests for information from competition regulators in the future, and that such requests “have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome” and could hurt business relationships. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- As of January 26, 2025 (year‑end Form 10‑K), NVIDIA reported that it had not recorded any accrued contingent liabilities for the legal proceedings described in the filing because it believed liabilities were possible but not probable; any possible loss could not be reasonably estimated at that time. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm))

- As of April 27, 2025 (quarterly Form 10‑Q), NVIDIA again reported there were no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described in that report, for the same reasons (liabilities possible but not probable; loss not reasonably estimable). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm))

- NVIDIA’s filings disclose that it provides indemnities (promises to cover certain losses) in agreements (for example, for tax, product, employee liabilities and intellectual property indemnities) and that maximum potential payments under some indemnities cannot be estimated. ([cdn.yahoofinance.com](https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-filings/0001045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s public policy statement says the company may spend money to educate policymakers and may hire intermediaries to advocate on its behalf when it is in the company’s interest. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000104/nvda-20240514.htm?utm_source=openai))

- Official U.S. lobbying disclosure (LD‑2) filings for NVIDIA show reported lobbying expenses and list “competition policy” (and related judiciary or policy areas) among the issues lobbied. One LD‑2 filing (filed July 18, 2025) reports $620,000 in lobbying expenses for the reporting period and includes “artificial intelligence, competition policy” among the issues. ([lda.senate.gov](https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/65879724-313e-4683-a5e5-95c3dbc310e0/print/))

- Earlier LD‑2 filings show smaller reported lobbying amounts and also include competition-related issues (example: a 2024 LD‑2 filing reporting $80,000). ([lda.senate.gov](https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/8473a5be-1516-413c-953d-a9e0aa42ace9/print/?utm_source=openai))

- OpenSecrets aggregates show NVIDIA’s reported federal lobbying spending for 2024 as $640,000. ([opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/nvidia-corp/summary?id=D000036303&utm_source=openai))

- News reports say U.S. authorities (the Department of Justice) and other regulators have opened antitrust inquiries or issued subpoenas and requests for information about NVIDIA’s market practices; media reports also describe scrutiny in the EU and France. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/nvidia-hit-with-subpoena-us-justice-department-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-09-03/?utm_source=openai))

## Point 18 - Question 6

**Based on precedent cases in comparable industries, how likely is the company to avoid or withstand future legal challenges without material loss of market power?**

### Research Findings

- What NVIDIA sells and where it is strongest: NVIDIA makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used by gamers and by companies that run artificial‑intelligence (AI) and data‑center workloads. Several industry reports show NVIDIA holds an overwhelmingly large share of the high‑end data‑center/AI GPU market and of the desktop add‑in (discrete) GPU market in recent years. ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))

- Data‑center GPU numbers (examples from independent market researchers): a 2023 study reported NVIDIA shipped about 3.76 million data‑center GPUs in 2023 and claimed roughly 98% share of data‑center GPU shipments that year; separate market trackers (Jon Peddie Research) reported NVIDIA at roughly 90%+ share of discrete GPU shipments in quarters of 2024–2025. ([hpcwire.com](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/?utm_source=openai))

- NVIDIA’s software and ecosystem lock‑in: NVIDIA offers a widely used software stack (CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT and related developer tools) that many researchers and businesses use to build and run AI code. This software ecosystem and developer base make it harder and slower for customers to switch to other chipmakers. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA?utm_source=openai))

- Major customer and cloud partnerships: NVIDIA has formal partnerships and integrations with major cloud providers and AI firms (for example with Microsoft Azure and other cloud offerings), and it has announced large strategic co‑operations with AI developers. Such partnerships can create long‑term buying relationships between big customers and NVIDIA. ([nvidianews.nvidia.com](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-microsoft-to-bring-the-industrial-metaverse-and-ai-to-hundreds-of-millions-of-enterprise-users-via-azure-cloud?utm_source=openai))

- Regulatory attention toward NVIDIA: U.S. federal authorities (DOJ and FTC) and some European regulators have sought information or opened probes into NVIDIA’s market conduct and certain acquisitions; French authorities conducted inspections in 2023, and NVIDIA has faced follow‑up reviews and legal fights in Europe about small deals. ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211810/nvidia-doj-antitrust-probes-ai-market-dominance?utm_source=openai))

- Example – Qualcomm (semiconductor supplier of phone chips): the U.S. FTC sued Qualcomm over licensing and supply practices. A U.S. district court ruled for the FTC in 2019, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that ruling in 2020, vacating the injunctive remedies. The appeals court said the FTC had not proved the required competitive harm under the rule‑of‑reason test. ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/141-0199-qualcomm-inc?utm_source=openai))

- Example – Intel (PC processor market): the European Commission fined Intel €1.06 billion in 2009 for rebates to PC makers that the Commission said excluded rivals. That long legal fight led to appellate reviews; parts of the Commission’s original decision were later annulled or narrowed by EU courts, and a reduced fine (€376 million) and other litigation steps followed. The Intel case shows multi‑year legal processes, appeals, and mixed outcomes in the chip industry context. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/cd83b6e20de5d68cb5403e8d5bc63fb6?utm_source=openai))

- Example – Broadcom (chip supplier and software deals): the U.S. FTC charged Broadcom in 2021 with illegal monopolization over certain set‑top box and broadband chips and proposed a consent order to stop exclusivity clauses; in merger reviews, the EU approved Broadcom’s $69bn acquisition of VMware in 2023 but imposed remedies and later faced appeals and criticism from cloud providers about licensing changes. These actions show regulators focusing on exclusivity and licensing terms and using consent orders and merger remedies. ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-charges-broadcom-illegal-monopolization-orders-semiconductor-supplier-cease-its-anticompetitive?utm_source=openai))

- Example – merger divestiture remedies in recent semiconductor‑related deals: U.S. antitrust agencies have required divestitures as a condition to allow some large industry combinations (for example the FTC required divestitures to resolve concerns in the Synopsys‑Ansys transaction in 2025). Regulators can impose divestitures in mergers when they find the deal would otherwise reduce competition. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-ftc-will-require-synopsys-ansys-divest-certain-assets-resolve-merger-concerns-2025-05-28/?utm_source=openai))

- How U.S. courts and agencies decide these cases (simple terms): to win a monopolization or unlawful‑conduct case, a government agency or private plaintiff usually must show (1) the firm has market power in a clearly defined product market and (2) the firm used exclusionary conduct that harms competition and consumers (not just that it is successful). Courts usually apply a “rule of reason” analysis, weighing harms against business justifications. Market share alone is helpful evidence of power but is not the whole test. ([justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-0?utm_source=openai))

- Typical remedies and how often they happen: regulators commonly use behavioral remedies (orders to stop certain contracts, end exclusivity, change licensing terms) and merger‑related structural remedies (required divestitures of assets) when they intervene. Full breakups of companies are rare in modern practice and tend to be historical exceptions rather than the norm. ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-charges-broadcom-illegal-monopolization-orders-semiconductor-supplier-cease-its-anticompetitive?utm_source=openai))

- Appeals and reversals are common: enforcement actions often take many years, and lower‑court rulings or regulator decisions can be reversed, narrowed, or modified on appeal (as happened in Qualcomm and in parts of the Intel litigation). This means final outcomes can change substantially after initial rulings. ([law.justia.com](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16122/19-16122-2020-08-11.html?utm_source=openai))

- What courts and regulators look for in practice (plain terms): they look for real effects on customers (higher prices, worse quality, or blocked rivals), not just statements that a company is “big.” They also examine how easy it is for rivals to enter or expand, whether customers can switch, and whether the firm’s practices have pro‑competitive benefits (like better products). Guidelines from U.S. enforcement agencies describe tests and concentration measures (like the HHI index) that agencies use when assessing market power and merger risk. ([justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-0?utm_source=openai))

- Recent enforcement posture (policy context): U.S. antitrust agencies have signaled tougher scrutiny of large technology and platform firms, including proposals to lower thresholds for intervention in some mergers and to treat certain market shares as presumptively problematic. At the same time, courts continue to apply long‑standing legal standards that require showing harm to competition. ([foley.com](https://www.foley.com/insights/publications/2023/07/doj-ftc-overhaul-merger-guidelines/?utm_source=openai))

- Litigation and contract examples involving NVIDIA‑related technologies: NVIDIA has faced trademark and patent suits and competitor complaints tied to its hardware, software, and acquisitions; some startups and rivals have filed suits alleging patent infringement or unfair licensing and buying practices. These are active legal matters in the industry that can lead to private damages suits or regulatory complaints. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/nvidia-hit-with-trademark-lawsuit-over-modulus-ai-software-2024-04-08/?utm_source=openai))

- Timing and length of proceedings: antitrust investigations and trials in this industry can last years, often with multiple appeals; some decisions are made by regulators (consent orders or merger conditions) while others proceed through courts with possible reversals. Historical and recent cases show that final legal outcomes are frequently delayed and uncertain. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-european-union-european-commission-50e0946697fb88b95d7dbe741a6770ab?utm_source=openai))

- Summary of legal precedents (simple list of outcomes):
  - Qualcomm: district court win for regulator (2019) then reversed on appeal (2020). ([law.justia.com](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16122/19-16122-2020-08-11.html?utm_source=openai))
  - Intel: large EU fine (2009) followed by long appeals; parts of the Commission’s decision were annulled and the case produced a later reduced fine and extended litigation. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/cd83b6e20de5d68cb5403e8d5bc63fb6?utm_source=openai))
  - Broadcom: FTC complaint led to proposed orders against exclusivity; EU merger review of VMware produced remedies and later appeals from cloud providers. ([ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-charges-broadcom-illegal-monopolization-orders-semiconductor-supplier-cease-its-anticompetitive?utm_source=openai))
  - Synopsys/Ansys (2025): FTC required divestitures to resolve merger concerns in software used to design semiconductors. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-ftc-will-require-synopsys-ansys-divest-certain-assets-resolve-merger-concerns-2025-05-28/?utm_source=openai))
